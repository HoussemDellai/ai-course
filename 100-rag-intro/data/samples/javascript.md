[Source code](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)

> [!NOTE]
> This article has been updated to use the [latest OpenAI npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) which now fully supports Azure OpenAI. If you are looking for code examples for the legacy Azure OpenAI JavaScript SDK they are currently still [available in this repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai/samples/v1-beta/javascript).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the `gpt-35-turbo-instruct` model deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

## Install the client library

Install the required packages for JavaScript with npm from within the context of your new directory:

```console
npm install openai dotenv @azure/identity
```

Your app's _package.json_ file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Create a sample application

Open a command prompt where you created the new project, and create a new file named Completion.js. Copy the following code into the Completion.js file.

```javascript
const { AzureOpenAI } = require("openai");

// Load the .env file if it exists
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config();

// You will need to set these environment variables or edit the following values
const endpoint = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] || "<endpoint>";
const apiKey = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] || "<api key>";
const apiVersion = "2024-04-01-preview";
const deployment = "gpt-35-turbo-instruct"; //The deployment name for your completions API model. The instruct model is the only new model that supports the legacy API.

const prompt = ["When was Microsoft founded?"];

async function main() {
  console.log("== Get completions Sample ==");

  const client = new AzureOpenAI({ endpoint, apiKey, apiVersion, deployment });  

  const result = await client.completions.create({ prompt, model: deployment, max_tokens: 128 });

  for (const choice of result.choices) {
    console.log(choice.text);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error occurred:", err);
});

module.exports = { main };
```

Run the script with the following command:

```cmd
node.exe Completion.js
```

## Output

```output
== Get completions Sample ==

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975.
```

## Microsoft Entra ID

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the previous example we are demonstrating key-based authentication. Once you have tested with key-based authentication successfully, we recommend using the more secure [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis) for authentication which is demonstrated in the next code sample. Getting started with [Microsoft Entra ID] will require some additional [prerequisites](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity).

```javascript
const { AzureOpenAI } = require("openai");
const { DefaultAzureCredential, getBearerTokenProvider } = require("@azure/identity");

// Set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT to the endpoint of your
// OpenAI resource. You can find this in the Azure portal.
// Load the .env file if it exists
require("dotenv/config");

const prompt = ["When was Microsoft founded?"];

async function main() {
  console.log("== Get completions Sample ==");

  const scope = "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default";
  const azureADTokenProvider = getBearerTokenProvider(new DefaultAzureCredential(), scope);
  const deployment = "gpt-35-turbo-instruct";
  const apiVersion = "2024-04-01-preview";
  const client = new AzureOpenAI({ azureADTokenProvider, deployment, apiVersion });
  const result = await client.completions.create({ prompt, model: deployment, max_tokens: 128 });

  for (const choice of result.choices) {
    console.log(choice.text);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error occurred:", err);
});

module.exports = { main };
```

> [!NOTE]
> If your receive the error: *Error occurred: OpenAIError: The `apiKey` and `azureADTokenProvider` arguments are mutually exclusive; only one can be passed at a time.* You may need to remove a pre-existing environment variable for the API key from your system. Even though the Microsoft Entra ID code sample is not explicitly referencing the API key environment variable, if one is present on the system executing this sample, this error will still be generated.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
