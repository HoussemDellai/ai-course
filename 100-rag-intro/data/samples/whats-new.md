# What's new in Azure OpenAI Service

This article provides a summary of the latest releases and major documentation updates for Azure OpenAI.

## May 2024

### GPT-4o provisioned deployments

`gpt-4o` Version: `2024-05-13` is available for both standard and provisioned deployments. Provisioned and standard model deployments accept both text and image/vision inference requests.
For information on model regional availability consult the model matrix for [provisioned deployments](./concepts/models.md#provisioned-deployment-model-availability).

### Assistants v2 (preview)

A refresh of the Assistants API is now publicly available. It contains the following updates:

* [File search tool and vector storage](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2272425)
* [Max completion and max prompt token support](./concepts/assistants.md) for managing token usage.
* `tool_choice` [parameter](./assistants-reference-runs.md#run-object) for forcing the Assistant to use a specified tool. 
You can now create messages with the [assistant](.//assistants-reference-messages.md#create-message) role to create custom conversation histories in Threads.
* Support for `temperature`, `top_p`, `response_format` [parameters](./assistants-reference.md#create-an-assistant).
* Streaming and polling support. You can use the helper functions in our Python SDK to create runs and stream responses. We have also added polling SDK helpers to share object status updates without the need for polling. 
* Experiment with [Logic Apps and Function Calling using Azure OpenAI Studio](./how-to/assistants-logic-apps.md). Import your REST APIs implemented in Logic Apps as functions and the studio invokes the function (as a Logic Apps workflow) automatically based on the user prompt.
* AutoGen by Microsoft Research provides a multi-agent conversation framework to enable convenient building of Large Language Model (LLM) workflows across a wide range of applications. Azure OpenAI assistants are now integrated into AutoGen via `GPTAssistantAgent`, a new experimental agent that lets you seamlessly add Assistants into AutoGen-based multi-agent workflows. This enables multiple Azure OpenAI assistants that could be task or domain specialized to collaborate and tackle complex tasks.
* Support for fine-tuned `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` [models](./concepts/models.md#assistants-preview) in the following regions:
    * East US 2
    * Sweden Central
* Expanded [regional support](./concepts/models.md#assistants-preview) for:
    * Japan East
    * UK South
    * West US
    * West US 3
    * Norway east

### GPT-4o model general availability (GA)

GPT-4o ("o is for "omni") is the latest model from OpenAI launched on May 13, 2024.

- GPT-4o integrates text, and images in a single model, enabling it to handle multiple data types simultaneously. This multimodal approach enhances accuracy and responsiveness in human-computer interactions.
- GPT-4o matches GPT-4 Turbo in English text and coding tasks while offering superior performance in non-English languages and in vision tasks, setting new benchmarks for AI capabilities.

For information on model regional availability, see the [models page](./concepts/models.md).

### Global standard deployment type (preview)

Global deployments are available in the same Azure OpenAI resources as non-global offers but allow you to leverage Azure's global infrastructure to dynamically route traffic to the data center with best availability for each request. Global standard will provide the highest default quota for new models and eliminates the need to load balance across multiple resources.

For more information, see the [deployment types guide](https://aka.ms/aoai/docs/deployment-types).

### Fine-tuning updates

- GPT-4 fine-tuning is [now available in public preview](./concepts/models.md#fine-tuning-models).
- Added support for [seed](/azure/ai-services/openai/tutorials/fine-tune?tabs=python-new%2Ccommand-line#begin-fine-tuning), [events](/azure/ai-services/openai/tutorials/fine-tune?tabs=python-new%2Ccommand-line#list-fine-tuning-events), [full validation statistics](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?tabs=turbo%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-python#analyze-your-customized-model), and [checkpoints](/azure/ai-services/openai/tutorials/fine-tune?tabs=python-new%2Ccommand-line#list-checkpoints) as part of the `2024-05-01-preview` API release.

### DALL-E and GPT-4 Turbo Vision GA configurable content filters

Create custom content filters for your DALL-E 2 and 3 and GPT-4 Turbo with Vision GA (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09) deployments. [Content filtering](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter?tabs=warning%2Cpython-new#configurability-preview)

Then you can adjust your filter configuration to better serve your business needs and meet Responsible AI principles.

[Use Risks & Safety monitoring](./how-to/risks-safety-monitor.md)

### Azure OpenAI On Your Data updates

- You can now connect to an Elasticsearch vector database to be used with [Azure OpenAI On Your Data](./concepts/use-your-data.md?tabs=elasticsearch#supported-data-sources).
- You can use the [chunk size parameter](./concepts/use-your-data.md#chunk-size-preview) during data ingestion to set the maximum number of tokens of any given chunk of data in your index.

### 2024-02-01 general availability (GA) API released

This is the latest GA API release and is the replacement for the previous `2023-05-15` GA release. This release adds support for the latest Azure OpenAI GA features like Whisper, DALLE-3, fine-tuning, on your data, etc.

Features that are still in preview such as Assistants, text to speech (TTS), certain on your data datasources, still require a preview API version. For more information check out our [API version lifecycle guide](./api-version-deprecation.md).

### Whisper general availability (GA)

The Whisper speech to text model is now GA for both REST and Python. Client library SDKs are currently still in public preview.

Try out Whisper by following a [quickstart](./whisper-quickstart.md).

### DALL-E 3 general availability (GA)

DALL-E 3 image generation model is now GA for both REST and Python. Client library SDKs are currently still in public preview.

Try out DALL-E 3 by following a [quickstart](./dall-e-quickstart.md).

### New regional support for DALL-E 3

You can now access DALL-E 3 with an Azure OpenAI resource in the `East US` or `AustraliaEast` Azure region, in addition to `SwedenCentral`.

### Model deprecations and retirements

We have added a page to track [model deprecations and retirements](./concepts/model-retirements.md) in Azure OpenAI Service. This page provides information about the models that are currently available, deprecated, and retired.

### 2024-03-01-preview API released

`2024-03-01-preview` has all the same functionality as `2024-02-15-preview` and adds two new parameters for embeddings:

- `encoding_format` allows you to specify the format to generate embeddings in `float`, or `base64`. The default is `float`.
- `dimensions` allows you set the number of output embeddings. This parameter is only supported with the new third generation embeddings models: `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-3-small`. Typically larger embeddings are more expensive from a compute, memory, and storage perspective. Being able to adjust the number of dimensions allows more control over overall cost and performance. The `dimensions` parameter is not supported in all versions of the OpenAI 1.x Python library, to take advantage of this parameter  we recommend upgrading to the latest version: `pip install openai --upgrade`.

If you are currently using a preview API version to take advantage of the latest features, we recommend consulting the [API version lifecycle](./api-version-deprecation.md) article to track how long your current API version will be supported.

### Update to GPT-4-1106-Preview upgrade plans

The deployment upgrade of `gpt-4` 1106-Preview to `gpt-4` 0125-Preview scheduled for March 8, 2024 is no longer taking place. Deployments of `gpt-4` versions 1106-Preview and 0125-Preview set to "Auto-update to default" and "Upgrade when expired" will start to be upgraded after a stable version of the model is released.  

For more information on the upgrade process refer to the [models page](./concepts/models.md).

## February 2024

### GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model available

This model has various improvements, including higher accuracy at responding in requested formats and a fix for a bug which caused a text encoding issue for non-English language function calls.

For information on model regional availability and upgrades refer to the [models page](./concepts/models.md).

### Third generation embeddings models available

- `text-embedding-3-large`
- `text-embedding-3-small`

In testing, OpenAI reports both the large and small third generation embeddings models offer better average multi-language retrieval performance with the [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) benchmark while still maintaining better performance for English tasks with the [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) benchmark than the second generation text-embedding-ada-002 model.

For information on model regional availability and upgrades refer to the [models page](./concepts/models.md).

### GPT-3.5 Turbo quota consolidation

To simplify migration between different versions of the GPT-3.5-Turbo models (including 16k), we will be consolidating all GPT-3.5-Turbo quota into a single quota value.

- Any customers who have increased quota approved will have combined total quota that reflects the previous increases.

- Any customer whose current total usage across model versions is less than the default will get a new combined total quota by default.

### GPT-4-0125-preview model available

The `gpt-4` model version `0125-preview` is now available on Azure OpenAI Service in the East US, North Central US, and South Central US regions.  Customers with deployments of `gpt-4` version `1106-preview` will be automatically upgraded to `0125-preview` in the coming weeks.

## January 2023

### New Features

* **Service GA**. Azure OpenAI Service is now generally available.â€‹

* **New models**: Addition of the latest text model, text-davinci-003 (East US, West Europe), text-ada-embeddings-002 (East US, South Central US, West Europe)


## December 2022

### New features

* **The latest models from OpenAI.** Azure OpenAI provides access to all the latest models including the GPT-3.5 seriesâ€‹.

* **New API version (2022-12-01).** This update includes several requested enhancements including token usage information in the API response, improved error messages for files, alignment with OpenAI on fine-tuning creation data structure, and support for the suffix parameter to allow custom naming of fine-tuned jobs.  â€‹

* **Higher request per second limits.** 50 for non-Davinci models. 20 for Davinci models.â€‹

* **Faster fine-tune deployments.** Deploy an Ada and Curie fine-tuned models in under 10 minutes.â€‹

* **Higher training limits:** 40M training tokens for Ada, Babbage, and Curie. 10M for Davinci.â€‹

* **Process for requesting modifications to the abuse & miss-use data logging & human review.** Today, the service logs request/response data for the purposes of abuse and misuse detection to ensure that these powerful models aren't abused. However, many customers have strict data privacy and security requirements that require greater control over their data. To support these use cases, we're releasing a new process for customers to modify the content filtering policies or turn off the abuse logging for low-risk use cases. This process follows the established Limited Access process within Azure AI services and [existing OpenAI customers can apply here](https://aka.ms/oai/modifiedaccess).â€‹

* **Customer managed key (CMK) encryption.** CMK provides customers greater control over managing their data in Azure OpenAI by providing their own encryption keys used for storing training data and customized models. Customer-managed keys (CMK), also known as bring your own key (BYOK), offer greater flexibility to create, rotate, disable, and revoke access controls. You can also audit the encryption keys used to protect your data. [Learn more from our encryption at rest documentation](encrypt-data-at-rest.md).

* **Lockbox support**â€‹

* **SOC-2 compliance**â€‹

* **Logging and diagnostics** through Azure Resource Health, Cost Analysis, and Metrics & Diagnostic settingsâ€‹.

* **Studio improvements.** Numerous usability improvements to the Studio workflow including Azure AD role support to control who in the team has access to create fine-tuned models and deploy.

### Changes (breaking)

**Fine-tuning** create API request has been updated to match OpenAIâ€™s schema.

**Preview API versions:**

```json
{â€‹
    "training_file": "file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY",â€‹
    "hyperparams": { â€‹
        "batch_size": 4,â€‹
        "learning_rate_multiplier": 0.1,â€‹
        "n_epochs": 4,â€‹
        "prompt_loss_weight": 0.1,â€‹
    }â€‹
}
```

**API version 2022-12-01:**

```json
{â€‹
    "training_file": "file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY",â€‹
    "batch_size": 4,â€‹
    "learning_rate_multiplier": 0.1,â€‹
    "n_epochs": 4,â€‹
    "prompt_loss_weight": 0.1,â€‹
}
```

**Content filtering is temporarily off** by default. Azure content moderation works differently than Azure OpenAI. Azure OpenAI runs content filters during the generation call to detect harmful or abusive content and filters them from the response. [Learn Moreâ€‹](./concepts/content-filter.md)

â€‹These models will be re-enabled in Q1 2023 and be on by default. â€‹

â€‹**Customer actions**â€‹

* [Contact Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview) if you would like these turned on for your subscriptionâ€‹.
* [Apply for filtering modifications](https://aka.ms/oai/modifiedaccess), if you would like to have them remain off. (This option will be for low-risk use cases only.)â€‹
