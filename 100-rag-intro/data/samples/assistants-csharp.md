[Reference documentation](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.openai.assistants-readme?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context) |  [Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>
- The [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a [compatible model in a supported region](../concepts/models.md#assistants-preview).
- We recommend reviewing the [Responsible AI transparency note](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&tabs=text) and other [Responsible AI resources](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) to familiarize yourself with the capabilities and limitations of the Azure OpenAI Service.
- An Azure OpenAI resource with the `gpt-4 (1106-preview)` model deployed was used testing this example.

## Set up

### Create a new .NET Core application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `azure-openai-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" project with a single C# source file: *Program.cs*.

```dotnetcli
dotnet new console -n azure-openai-assistants-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors.

```output
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

Install the OpenAI .NET client library with:

```console
dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI.Assistants --prerelease
```

## Create an assistant

In our code we are going to specify the following values:

| **Name** | **Description** |
|:---|:---|
| **Assistant name** | Your deployment name that is associated with a specific model. |
| **Instructions** | Instructions are similar to system messages this is where you give the model guidance about how it should behave and any context it should reference when generating a response. You can describe the assistant's personality, tell it what it should and shouldn't answer, and tell it how to format responses. You can also provide examples of the steps it should take when answering responses. |
| **Model** | This is where you set which model deployment name to use with your assistant. The retrieval tool requires `gpt-35-turbo (1106)` or `gpt-4 (1106-preview)` model. **Set this value to your deployment name, not the model name unless it is the same.** |
| **Code interpreter** | Code interpreter provides access to a sandboxed Python environment that can be used to allow the model to test and execute code. |

### Tools

An individual assistant can access up to 128 tools including `code interpreter`, as well as any custom tools you create via [functions](../how-to/assistant-functions.md).

Create and run an assistant with the following:

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI.Assistants;

string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT") ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");
string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY") ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY");
AssistantsClient client = new AssistantsClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));

// Create an assistant
Assistant assistant = await client.CreateAssistantAsync(
    new AssistantCreationOptions("gpt-4-1106-preview") // Replace this with the name of your model deployment
    {
        Name = "Math Tutor",
        Instructions = "You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions.",
        Tools = { new CodeInterpreterToolDefinition() }
    });

// Create a thread
AssistantThread thread = await client.CreateThreadAsync();

// Add a user question to the thread
ThreadMessage message = await client.CreateMessageAsync(
    thread.Id,
    MessageRole.User,
    "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?");

// Run the thread
ThreadRun run = await client.CreateRunAsync(
    thread.Id,
    new CreateRunOptions(assistant.Id)
);

// Wait for the assistant to respond
do
{
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500));
    run = await client.GetRunAsync(thread.Id, run.Id);
}
while (run.Status == RunStatus.Queued
    || run.Status == RunStatus.InProgress);

// Get the messages
PageableList<ThreadMessage> messagesPage = await client.GetMessagesAsync(thread.Id);
IReadOnlyList<ThreadMessage> messages = messagesPage.Data;

// Note: messages iterate from newest to oldest, with the messages[0] being the most recent
foreach (ThreadMessage threadMessage in messages.Reverse())
{
    Console.Write($"{threadMessage.CreatedAt:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - {threadMessage.Role,10}: ");
    foreach (MessageContent contentItem in threadMessage.ContentItems)
    {
        if (contentItem is MessageTextContent textItem)
        {
            Console.Write(textItem.Text);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}
```

This will print an output as follows:

```
2024-03-05 03:38:17 -       user: I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?
2024-03-05 03:38:25 -  assistant: The solution to the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\) is \(x = 1\).
```

New messages can be created on the thread before re-running, which will see the assistant use the past messages as context within the thread.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
