# Prompt engineering techniques

This guide will walk you through some advanced techniques in prompt design and prompt engineering. If you're new to prompt engineering, we recommend starting with our [introduction to prompt engineering guide](prompt-engineering.md).

While the principles of prompt engineering can be generalized across many different model types, certain models expect a specialized prompt structure. For Azure OpenAI GPT models, there are currently two distinct APIs where prompt engineering comes into play:

- Chat Completion API.
- Completion API.

Each API requires input data to be formatted differently, which in turn impacts overall prompt design. The **Chat Completion API** supports the GPT-35-Turbo and GPT-4 models. These models are designed to take input formatted in a [specific chat-like transcript](../how-to/chatgpt.md) stored inside an array of dictionaries.

The **Completion API** supports the older GPT-3 models and has much more flexible input requirements in that it takes a string of text with no specific format rules.

The techniques in this guide will teach you strategies for increasing the accuracy and grounding of responses you generate with a Large Language Model (LLM). It is, however, important to remember that even when using prompt engineering effectively you still need to validate the responses the models generate. Just because a carefully crafted prompt worked well for a particular scenario doesn't necessarily mean it will generalize more broadly to certain use cases. Understanding the [limitations of LLMs](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context#limitations), is just as important as understanding how to leverage their strengths.
