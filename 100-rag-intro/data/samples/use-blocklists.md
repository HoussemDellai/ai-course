# Use a blocklist in Azure OpenAI

The configurable content filters are sufficient for most content moderation needs. However, you may need to filter terms specific to your use case. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Once you have your Azure subscription, create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal to get your token, key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select the subscription you entered on the application form, select a resource group, supported region, and supported pricing tier. Then select **Create**.
    - The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, select **go to resource**. In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Subscription Key and Endpoint**. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed

## Use blocklists

You can create blocklists with the Azure OpenAI API. The following steps help you get started. 

### Get your token

First, you need to get a token for accessing the APIs for creating, editing and deleting blocklists. You can get this token using the following Azure CLI command: 

```bash
az account get-access-token 
```

### Create or modify a blocklist

Copy the cURL command below to a text editor and make the following changes: 

1. Replace {subscriptionId} with your subscription ID. 
1. Replace {resourceGroupName} with your resource group name. 
1. Replace {accountName} with your resource name. 
1. Replace {raiBlocklistName} (in the URL) with a custom name for your list. Allowed characters: `0-9, A-Z, a-z, - . _ ~`. 
1. Replace {token} with the token you got from the "Get your token" step above. 
1. Optionally replace the value of the "description" field with a custom description.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{accountName}/raiBlocklists/{raiBlocklistName}?api-version=2024-03-01-preview' \ 
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \ 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
--data-raw '{ 
    "properties": { 
        "description": "This is a prompt blocklist"  
    } 
}' 
```

The response code should be `201` (created a new list) or `200` (updated an existing list). 

### Apply a blocklist to a content filter

If you haven't yet created a content filter, you can do so in the Studio in the Content Filters tab on the left hand side. In order to use the blocklist, make sure this Content Filter is applied to an Azure OpenAI deployment. You can do this in the Deployments tab on the left hand side. 

To apply a **completion** blocklist to a content filter, use the following cURL command: 

1. Replace {subscriptionId} with your sub ID. 
1. Replace {resourceGroupName} with your resource group name. 
1. Replace {accountName} with your resource name. 
1. Replace {raiPolicyName} with the name of your Content Filter 
1. Replace {token} with the token you got from the "Get your token" step above. 
1. Replace "raiBlocklistName" in the body with a custom name for your list. Allowed characters: `0-9, A-Z, a-z, - . _ ~`. 

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{accountName}/raiPolicies/{raiPolicyName}?api-version=2024-03-01-preview' \ 
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \ 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
--data-raw '{ 
    "properties": { 
        "basePolicyName": "Microsoft.Default", 
        "completionBlocklists": [{ 
            "blocklistName": "raiBlocklistName", 
            "blocking": true 
        }], 
        "contentFilters": [ ] 
    } 
}' 
```

### Add blockItems to the list

> [!NOTE]
> There is a maximum limit of 10,000 terms allowed in one list.

Copy the cURL command below to a text editor and make the following changes:
1. Replace {subscriptionId} with your sub ID. 
1. Replace {resourceGroupName} with your resource group name. 
1. Replace {accountName} with your resource name. 
1. Replace {raiBlocklistName} (in the URL) with a custom name for your list. Allowed characters: `0-9, A-Z, a-z, - . _ ~`. 
1. Replace {raiBlocklistItemName} with a custom name for your list item. 
1. Replace {token} with the token you got from the "Get your token" step above. 
1. Replace the value of the `"blocking pattern"` field with the item you'd like to add to your blocklist. The maximum length of a blockItem is 1000 characters. Also specify whether the pattern is regex or exact match. 

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/{accountName}/raiBlocklists/{raiBlocklistName}/raiBlocklistItems/{raiBlocklistItemName}?api-version=2024-03-01-preview' \ 
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \ 
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ 
--data-raw '{  
    "properties": {  
        "pattern": "blocking pattern",  
        "isRegex": false  
    }  
}' 
```

> [!NOTE]
> It can take around 5 minutes for a new term to be added to the blocklist. Please test after 5 minutes. 

The response code should be `200`. 

```json
{ 
  "name": "raiBlocklistItemName", 
  "id": "/subscriptions/subscriptionId/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/accountName/raiBlocklists/raiBlocklistName/raiBlocklistItems/raiBlocklistItemName", 
  "properties": { 
    "pattern": "blocking pattern", 
    "isRegex": false 
  } 
} 
```

### Analyze text with a blocklist

Now you can test out your deployment that has the blocklist. The easiest way to do this is in the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/portal/). If the content was blocked either in prompt or completion, you should see an error message saying the content filtering system was triggered.

For instruction on calling the Azure OpenAI endpoints, visit the [Quickstart](/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart). 

In the below example, a GPT-35-Turbo deployment with a blocklist is blocking the prompt. The response returns a `400` error. 

```json
{ 
    "error": { 
        "message": "The response was filtered due to the prompt triggering Azure OpenAIâ€™s content management policy. Please modify your prompt and retry. To learn more about our content filtering policies please read our documentation: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2198766", 
        "type": null, 
        "param": "prompt", 
        "code": "content_filter", 
        "status": 400, 
        "innererror": { 
            "code": "ResponsibleAIPolicyViolation", 
            "content_filter_result": { 
                "custom_blocklists": [ 
                    { 
                        "filtered": true, 
                        "id": "raiBlocklistName" 
                    } 
                ], 
                "hate": { 
                    "filtered": false, 
                    "severity": "safe" 
                }, 
                "self_harm": { 
                    "filtered": false, 
                    "severity": "safe" 
                }, 
                "sexual": { 
                    "filtered": false, 
                    "severity": "safe" 
                }, 
                "violence": { 
                    "filtered": false, 
                    "severity": "safe" 
                } 
            } 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

If the completion itself is blocked, the response returns `200`, as the completion only cuts off when the blocklist content is matched. The annotations show that a blocklist was matched.

    "id": "chatcmpl-85NkyY0AkeBMunOjyxivQSiTaxGAl",

## Use blocklists in Azure OpenAI Studio

You can also create custom blocklists in the Azure OpenAI Studio as part of your content filtering configurations (public preview). Instructions on how to create custom content filters can be found [here](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters). The following steps show how to create custom blocklists as part of your content filters via Azure OpenAI Studio. 

1. Select the Blocklists tab next to Content filters tab.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/blocklist-select.jpg" alt-text="screenshot of blocklist selection." lightbox="../media/content-filters/blocklist-select.jpg":::
1. Select Create blocklist
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/blocklist-select-create.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of blocklist create selection." lightbox="../media/content-filters/blocklist-select-create.jpg":::
1. Create a name for your blocklist, add a description and select on Create.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/create-blocklist.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of blocklist naming." lightbox="../media/content-filters/create-blocklist.jpg":::
1. Select your custom blocklist once it's created, and select Add term. 
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/custom-blocklist-add.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of custom blocklist add term." lightbox="../media/content-filters/custom-blocklist-add.jpg":::
1. Add a term that should be filtered, and select Create. You can also create a regex.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/custom-blocklist-add-item.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of custom blocklist add item." lightbox="../media/content-filters/custom-blocklist-add-item.jpg":::
1. You can Edit and Delete every term in your blocklist. 
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/custom-blocklist-edit.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of custom blocklist edit." lightbox="../media/content-filters/custom-blocklist-edit.jpg":::
1. Once the blocklist is ready, navigate to the Content filters (Preview) section and create a new customized content filter configuration. This opens a wizard with several AI content safety components. You can find more information on how to configure the main filters and optional models [here](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters). Go to Add blocklist (Optional).
1. You'll now see all available blocklists. There are two types of blocklists â€“ the blocklists you created, and prebuilt blocklists that Microsoft provides, in this case a Profanity blocklist (English)
1. You can now decide which of the available blocklists you would like to include in your content filtering configuration, and you can select if it should apply to and filter prompts, completions or both. In the below example, we apply CustomBlocklist1 that we just created to prompts and completions, and the Profanity blocklist to completions only. The last step is to review and finish the content filtering configuration by clicking on Next.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/content-filters/filtering-configuration-manage.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of filtering configuration management." lightbox="../media/content-filters/filtering-configuration-manage.jpg":::
1. You can always go back and edit your configuration. Once itâ€™s ready, select on Create content filter. The new configuration that includes your blocklists can now be applied to a deployment. Detailed instructions can be found [here](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters).
