# Uninstall the Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

This article shows you how to uninstall the OMS add-on and related resources from your AKS cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> With the retirement of [Open Service Mesh (OSM)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), we recommend identifying your OSM configurations and migrating them to an equivalent Istio configuration. For information about migrating from OSM to Istio, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance.md).

## Disable the OSM add-on from your cluster

* Disable the OSM add-on from your cluster using the [`az aks disable-addon`][az-aks-disable-addon] command and the `--addons` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks disable-addons \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --name myAKSCluster \
      --addons open-service-mesh
    ```

## Remove OSM resources

* Uninstall the remaining resources on the cluster using the `osm uninstall cluster-wide-resources` command.

    ```console
    osm uninstall cluster-wide-resources
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For version 1.1, the command is `osm uninstall mesh --delete-cluster-wide-resources`

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must remove these additional resources after you disable the OSM add-on. Leaving these resources on your cluster may cause issues if you enable the OSM add-on again in the future.
