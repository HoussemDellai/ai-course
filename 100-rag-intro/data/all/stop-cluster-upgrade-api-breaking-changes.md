# Stop Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes

To stay within a supported Kubernetes version, you have to upgrade your cluster at least once per year and prepare for all possible disruptions. These disruptions include ones caused by API breaking changes, deprecations, and dependencies such as Helm and Container Storage Interface (CSI). It can be difficult to anticipate these disruptions and migrate critical workloads without experiencing any downtime.

AKS now automatically stops upgrade operations consisting of a minor version change with deprecated APIs and sends you an error message to alert you about the issue.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

* The upgrade operation is a Kubernetes minor version change for the cluster control plane.
* The Kubernetes version you're upgrading to is 1.26 or later.
* The last seen usage of deprecated APIs for the targeted version you're upgrading to must occur within 12 hours before the upgrade operation. AKS records usage hourly, so any usage of deprecated APIs within one hour isn't guaranteed to appear in the detection.

## Mitigate stopped upgrade operations

If you meet the [prerequisites](#before-you-begin), attempt an upgrade, and receive an error message similar to the following example error message:

```output
Bad Request({
  "code": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Control Plane upgrade is blocked due to recent usage of a Kubernetes API deprecated in the specified version. Please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide to migrate the usage. To bypass this error, set enable-force-upgrade in upgradeSettings.overrideSettings. Bypassing this error without migrating usage will result in the deprecated Kubernetes API calls failing. Usage details: 1 error occurred:\n\t* usage has been detected on API flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io.prioritylevelconfigurations.v1beta1, and was recently seen at: 2023-03-23 20:57:18 +0000 UTC, which will be removed in 1.26\n\n",
  "subcode": "UpgradeBlockedOnDeprecatedAPIUsage"
})
```

You have two options to mitigate the issue. You can either [remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)](#remove-usage-of-deprecated-apis-recommended) or [bypass validation to ignore API changes](#bypass-validation-to-ignore-api-changes).

### Remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster's overview page, and select **Diagnose and solve problems**.

2. Navigate to the **Create, Upgrade, Delete, and Scale** category, and select **Kubernetes API deprecations**.

3. Wait 12 hours from the time the last deprecated API usage was seen. Check the verb in the deprecated API usage to know if it's a [watch][k8s-api].

4. Retry your cluster upgrade.

You can also check past API usage by enabling [Container Insights][container-insights] and exploring kube audit logs. Check the verb in the deprecated API usage to understand if it's a [watch][k8s-api] use case.

### Bypass validation to ignore API changes

> [!NOTE]
> This method requires you to use the Azure CLI version 2.53 or later. If you have the `aks-preview` CLI extension installed, you'll need to update to version `0.5.154` or later. This method isn't recommended, as deprecated APIs in the targeted Kubernetes version may not work long term. We recommend removing them as soon as possible after the upgrade completes.

* Bypass validation to ignore API breaking changes using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command. Specify the `enable-force-upgrade` flag and set the `upgrade-override-until` property to define the end of the window during which validation is bypassed. If no value is set, it defaults the window to three days from the current time. The date and time you specify must be in the future.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --enable-force-upgrade --upgrade-override-until 2023-10-01T13:00:00Z
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > `Z` is the zone designator for the zero UTC/GMT offset, also known as 'Zulu' time. This example sets the end of the window to `13:00:00` GMT. For more information, see [Combined date and time representations](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).

* Once the previous command has succeeded, you can retry the upgrade operation.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks upgrade --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --kubernetes-version <KUBERNETES_VERSION>
    ```
