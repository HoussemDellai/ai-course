# Use the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) extension for Visual Studio Code

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to easily view and manage your AKS clusters from your development environment.

## Features

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) extension for Visual Studio Code provides a rich set of features to help you manage your AKS clusters, including:

* **Merge into Kubeconfig**: Merge your AKS cluster into your `kubeconfig` file to manage your cluster from the command line.
* **Save Kubeconfig**: Save your AKS cluster configuration to a file.
* **AKS Diagnostics**: View diagnostics information based on your cluster's backend telemetry for identity, security, networking, node health, and create, upgrade, delete, and scale issues.
* **AKS Periscope**: Extract detailed diagnostic information and export it to an Azure storage account for further analysis.
* **Install Azure Service Operator (ASO)**: Deploy the latest version of ASO and provision Azure resources within Kubernetes.
* **Start or stop a cluster**: Start or stop your AKS cluster to save costs when you're not using it.
