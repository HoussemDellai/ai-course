#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to learn how to build a container-based application so that I can deploy the app to Azure Kubernetes Service.

# Tutorial - Prepare an application for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this tutorial, part one of seven, you prepare a multi-container application to use in Kubernetes. You use existing development tools like Docker Compose to locally build and test the application. You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
> * Create a container image from the sample application source.
> * Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

Once completed, the following application runs in your local development environment:

In later tutorials, you upload the container image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR), and then deploy it into an AKS cluster.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and `docker` commands. For a primer on container basics, see [Get started with Docker][docker-get-started].

To complete this tutorial, you need a local Docker development environment running Linux containers. Docker provides packages that configure Docker on a [Mac][docker-for-mac], [Windows][docker-for-windows], or [Linux][docker-for-linux] system.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Cloud Shell doesn't include the Docker components required to complete every step in these tutorials. Therefore, we recommend using a full Docker development environment.

## Get application code

The [sample application][sample-application] used in this tutorial is a basic store front app including the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-service-kubernetes-tutorials/aks-store-architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Store sample architecture." lightbox="./media/container-service-kubernetes-tutorials/aks-store-architecture.png":::

* **Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.
* **Product service**: Shows product information.
* **Order service**: Places orders.
* **Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.


### [Git](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Use [git][] to clone the sample application to your development environment.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo.git
    ```

2. Change into the cloned directory.

    ```console
    cd aks-store-demo
    ```


### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azure-azd)

1. If you're using `azd` locally, create an empty directory named `aks-store-demo` to host the azd template files.

    ```console
    mkdir aks-store-demo
    ```

2. Change into the new directory to load all the files from the azd template.

    ```console
    cd aks-store-demo
    ```

3. Clone the sample application into the `aks-store-demo` directory using the [`azd init`][azd-init] command with the `--template` flag set to `aks-store-demo`.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd init --template aks-store-demo
    ```

## Review Docker Compose file

The sample application you create in this tutorial uses the [*docker-compose-quickstart* YAML file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/blob/main/docker-compose-quickstart.yml) from the [repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main) you cloned.

```yaml

      retries: 5

    driver: bridge
```

## Create container images and run application 

### [Docker](#tab/azure-cli)

You can use [Docker Compose][docker-compose] to automate building container images and the deployment of multi-container applications.

### Docker

1. Create the container image, download the RabbitMQ image, and start the application using the `docker compose` command:

    ```console
    docker compose -f docker-compose-quickstart.yml up -d
    ```

2. View the created images using the [`docker images`][docker-images] command.

    ```console
    docker images
    ```

    The following condensed example output shows the created images:

    ```output
    REPOSITORY                       TAG                          IMAGE ID
    aks-store-demo-productservice    latest                       2b66a7e91eca
    aks-store-demo-orderservice      latest                       54ad5de546f9
    aks-store-demo-storefront        latest                       d9e3ac46a225
    rabbitmq                         3.11.17-management-alpine    79a570297657
    ...
    ```

3. View the running containers using the [`docker ps`][docker-ps] command.

    ```console
    docker ps
    ```

    The following condensed example output shows four running containers:

    ```output
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE
    21574cb38c1f        aks-store-demo-productservice
    c30a5ed8d86a        aks-store-demo-orderservice
    d10e5244f237        aks-store-demo-storefront
    94e00b50b86a        rabbitmq:3.11.17-management-alpine
    ```

## Test application locally

To see your running application, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in a local web browser. The sample application loads, as shown in the following example:

:::image type="content" source="./media/container-service-kubernetes-tutorials/aks-store-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Azure Store Front App opened in a local browser." lightbox="./media/container-service-kubernetes-tutorials/aks-store-application.png":::

On this page, you can view products, add them to your cart, and then place an order.

## Clean up resources

Since you validated the application's functionality, you can stop and remove the running containers. ***Do not delete the container images*** - you use them in the next tutorial.

* Stop and remove the container instances and resources using the [`docker-compose down`][docker-compose-down] command.

    ```console
    docker compose down
    ```

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azure-azd)

When you use `azd`, there are no manual container image dependencies. `azd` handles the provisioning, deployment, and clean up of your applications and clusters with the `azd up` and `azd down` commands, similar to Docker.

You can customize the preparation steps to use either Terraform or Bicep before deploying the cluster within the `infra` section of your `azure.yaml`. By default, this project uses Terraform:

```yml
infra:
  provider: terraform
  path: infra/terraform
```

If you want to change the provider to Bicep, update the `azure.yaml` file as follows:

```yml
infra:
  provider: bicep
  path: infra/bicep
```

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Clone a sample application source from GitHub.
> * Create a container image from the sample application source.
> * Test the multi-container application in a local Docker environment.

In the next tutorial, you learn how to store container images in an ACR.

> [Push images to Azure Container Registry][aks-tutorial-prepare-acr]

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azure-azd)

In this tutorial, you cloned a sample application using `azd`. You learned how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Clone a sample `azd` template from GitHub.
> * View where container images are used from the sample application source.
