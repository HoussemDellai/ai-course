# Deploy a Java application with WebLogic Server on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

This article demonstrates how to:

- Run your Java, Java EE, or Jakarta EE on Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS).
- Stand up a WLS cluster using the Azure Marketplace offer.
- Build the application Docker image to serve as auxiliary image to provide WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) models and applications.
- Deploy the containerized application to the existing WLS cluster on AKS with connection to Microsoft Azure SQL.

This article uses the Azure Marketplace offer for WLS to accelerate your journey to AKS. The offer automatically provisions several Azure resources, including the following resources:

- An Azure Container Registry instance
- An AKS cluster
- An Azure App Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) instance
- The WebLogic Operator
- A container image including the WebLogic runtime
- A WLS cluster without an application

Then, this article introduces building an auxiliary image step by step to update an existing WLS cluster. The auxiliary image provides application and WDT models.

For full automation, you can select your application and configure datasource connection from Azure portal before the offer deployment. To see the offer, visit the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/wlsaks).

For step-by-step guidance in setting up WebLogic Server on Azure Kubernetes Service, see the official documentation from Oracle at [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/samples/azure-kubernetes-service/).

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- Ensure the Azure identity you use to sign in and complete this article has either the [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role in the current subscription or the [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) and [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) roles in the current subscription. For an overview of Azure roles, see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) For details on the specific roles required by WLS on AKS, see [Azure built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).
- Have the credentials for an Oracle single sign-on (SSO) account. To create one, see [Create Your Oracle Account](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-create-sso-account).
- Accept the license terms for WLS.
  - Visit the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/) and sign in.
  - If you have a support entitlement, select **Middleware**, then search for and select **weblogic_cpu**.
  - If you don't have a support entitlement from Oracle, select **Middleware**, then search for and select **weblogic**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Get a support entitlement from Oracle before going to production. Failure to do so results in running insecure images that are not patched for critical security flaws. For more information on Oracle's critical patch updates, see [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) from Oracle.
  - Accept the license agreement.
- Prepare a local machine with Unix-like operating system installed (for example, Ubuntu, Azure Linux, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux).
  - [Azure CLI](/cli/azure). Use `az --version` to test whether az works. This document was tested with version 2.55.1.
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker). This document was tested with Docker version 20.10.7. Use `docker info` to test whether Docker Daemon is running.
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl). Use `kubectl version` to test whether kubectl works. This document was tested with version v1.21.2.
  - A Java JDK compatible with the version of WLS you intend to run. The article directs you to install a version of WLS that uses JDK 11. Azure recommends [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK](/java/openjdk/download). Ensure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly in the shells in which you run the commands.
  - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.0 or higher.
  - Ensure that you have the zip/unzip utility installed. Use `zip/unzip -v` to test whether `zip/unzip` works.
- All of the steps in this article, except for those involving Docker, can also be executed in the Azure Cloud Shell. To learn more about Azure Cloud Shell, see [What is Azure Cloud Shell?](/azure/cloud-shell/overview)

## Deploy WLS on AKS

The steps in this section direct you to deploy WLS on AKS in the simplest possible way. WLS on AKS offers a broad and deep selection of Azure integrations. For more information, see [What are solutions for running Oracle WebLogic Server on the Azure Kubernetes Service?](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/weblogic-aks)

The following steps show you how to find the WLS on AKS offer and fill out the **Basics** pane.

1. In the search bar at the top of the Azure portal, enter *weblogic*. In the auto-suggested search results, in the **Marketplace** section, select **WebLogic Server on AKS**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/marketplace-search-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows WLS in the search results." lightbox="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/marketplace-search-results.png":::

   You can also go directly to the [WebLogic Server on AKS](https://aka.ms/wlsaks) offer.

1. On the offer page, select **Create**.
1. On the **Basics** pane, ensure the value shown in the **Subscription** field is the same one that you logged into in Azure. Make sure you have the roles listed in the prerequisites section.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/portal-start-experience.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows WebLogic Server on AKS." lightbox="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/portal-start-experience.png":::

1. You must deploy the offer in an empty resource group. In the **Resource group** field, select **Create new** and then fill in a value for the resource group. Because resource groups must be unique within a subscription, pick a unique name. An easy way to have unique names is to use a combination of your initials, today's date, and some identifier - for example, `ejb0723wls`.
1. Under **Instance details**, select the region for the deployment. For a list of Azure regions where AKS is available, see [AKS region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service).
1. Under **Credentials for WebLogic**, leave the default value for **Username for WebLogic Administrator**.
1. Fill in `wlsAksCluster2022` for the **Password for WebLogic Administrator**. Use the same value for the confirmation and **Password for WebLogic Model encryption** fields.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the **Basics** pane and notice the helpful links for documentation, community support, and how to report problems.
1. Select **Next**.

The following steps show you how to start the deployment process.

1. Scroll to the section labeled **Provide an Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) account**. Fill in your Oracle SSO credentials from the preconditions.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/configure-single-sign-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the configured SSO pane." lightbox="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/configure-single-sign-on.png":::

1. Follow the steps in the info box starting with **Before moving forward, you must accept the Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions.**

1. Depending on whether or not the Oracle SSO account has an Oracle support entitlement, select the appropriate option for **Select the type of WebLogic Server Images.**. If the account has a support entitlement, select **Patched WebLogic Server Images**. Otherwise, select **General WebLogic Server Images**.

1. Leave the value in **Select desired combination of WebLogic Server...** at its default value. You have a broad range of choices for WLS, JDK, and OS version.

1. In the **Application** section, next to **Deploy an application?**, select **No**.

The following steps make it so the WLS admin console and the sample app are exposed to the public Internet with a built-in Application Gateway ingress add-on. For a more information, see [What is Application Gateway Ingress Controller?](/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview)

:::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/configure-load-balancing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the simplest possible load balancer configuration on the Create Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Kubernetes Service page." lightbox="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/configure-load-balancing.png":::

1. Select **Next** to see the **TLS/SSL** pane.
1. Select **Next** to see the **Load balancing** pane.
1. Next to **Load Balancing Options**, select **Application Gateway Ingress Controller**.
1. Under the **Application Gateway Ingress Controller**, you should see all fields prepopulated with the defaults for **Virtual network** and **Subnet**. Leave the default values.
1. For **Create ingress for Administration Console**, select **Yes**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/configure-appgateway-ingress-admin-console.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the Application Gateway Ingress Controller configuration on the Create Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Kubernetes Service page." lightbox="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/configure-appgateway-ingress-admin-console.png":::

1. Leave the default values for other fields.
1. Select **Review + create**. Ensure the validation doesn't fail. If it fails, fix any validation problems, then select **Review + create** again.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Track the progress of the deployment on the **Deployment is in progress** page.

Depending on network conditions and other activity in your selected region, the deployment might take up to 50 minutes to complete.

You can perform the steps in the section [Create an Azure SQL Database](#create-an-azure-sql-database) while you wait. Return to this section when you finish creating the database.

## Examine the deployment output

Use the steps in this section to verify that the deployment was successful.

If you navigated away from the **Deployment is in progress** page, the following steps show you how to get back to that page. If you're still on the page that shows **Your deployment is complete**, you can skip to step 5 after the next screenshot.

1. In the corner of any Azure portal page, select the hamburger menu and select **Resource groups**.
1. In the box with the text **Filter for any field**, enter the first few characters of the resource group you created previously. If you followed the recommended convention, enter your initials, then select the appropriate resource group.
1. In the navigation pane, in the **Settings** section, select **Deployments**. You see an ordered list of the deployments to this resource group, with the most recent one first.
1. Scroll to the oldest entry in this list. This entry corresponds to the deployment you started in the preceding section. Select the oldest deployment, as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/resource-group-deployments.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal that shows the resource group deployments list." lightbox="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/resource-group-deployments.png":::

1. In the navigation pane, select **Outputs**. This list shows the output values from the deployment. Useful information is included in the outputs.
1. The **adminConsoleExternalUrl** value is the fully qualified, public Internet visible link to the WLS admin console for this AKS cluster. Select the copy icon next to the field value to copy the link to your clipboard. Save this value aside for later.
1. The **clusterExternalUrl** value is the fully qualified, public Internet visible link to the sample app deployed in WLS on this AKS cluster. Select the copy icon next to the field value to copy the link to your clipboard. Save this value aside for later.
1. The **shellCmdtoOutputWlsImageModelYaml** value is the base64 string of WDT model that built in the container image. Save this value aside for later.
1. The **shellCmdtoOutputWlsImageProperties** value is base64 string of WDT model properties that built in the container image. Save this value aside for later.
1. The **shellCmdtoConnectAks** value is the Azure CLI command to connect to this specific AKS cluster. This lets you use `kubectl` to administer the cluster.

The other values in the outputs are beyond the scope of this article, but are explained in detail in the [WebLogic on AKS user guide](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs).

## Create an Azure SQL Database

[!INCLUDE [create-azure-sql-database](includes/jakartaee/create-azure-sql-database.md)]

2. Create a schema for the sample application. Follow [Query the database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart#query-the-database) to open the **Query editor** pane. Enter and run the following query:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE COFFEE (ID NUMERIC(19) NOT NULL, NAME VARCHAR(255) NULL, PRICE FLOAT(32) NULL, PRIMARY KEY (ID));
   CREATE TABLE SEQUENCE (SEQ_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, SEQ_COUNT NUMERIC(28) NULL, PRIMARY KEY (SEQ_NAME));
   INSERT INTO SEQUENCE VALUES ('SEQ_GEN',0);
   ```

   After a successful run, you should see the message **Query succeeded: Affected rows: 0**. If you don't see this message, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before proceeding.

The database, tables, AKS cluster, and WLS cluster are created. If you want, you can explore the admin console by opening a browser and navigating to the address of **adminConsoleExternalUrl**. Sign in with the values you entered during the WLS on AKS deployment.

You can proceed to preparing AKS to host your WebLogic application.

## Configure and deploy the sample application

The offer provisions the WLS cluster via [model in image](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/samples/domains/model-in-image/). Currently, the WLS cluster has no application deployed.

This section updates the WLS cluster by deploying a sample application using [auxiliary image](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/managing-domains/model-in-image/auxiliary-images/#using-docker-to-create-an-auxiliary-image).

### Check out the application

In this section, you clone the sample code for this guide. The sample is on GitHub in the [weblogic-on-azure](https://github.com/microsoft/weblogic-on-azure) repository in the *javaee/weblogic-cafe/* folder. Here's the file structure of the application.

```text

                └── components
                    └── inputPrice.xhtml
```

Use the following commands to clone the repository:

```bash
cd <parent-directory-to-check-out-sample-code>
export BASE_DIR=$PWD
git clone --single-branch https://github.com/microsoft/weblogic-on-azure.git --branch 20240201 $BASE_DIR/weblogic-on-azure
```

If you see a message about being in "detached HEAD" state, this message is safe to ignore. It just means you checked out a tag.

Use the following command to build *javaee/weblogic-cafe/*:

```bash
mvn clean package --file $BASE_DIR/weblogic-on-azure/javaee/weblogic-cafe/pom.xml
```

The package should be successfully generated and located at *$BASE_DIR/weblogic-on-azure/javaee/weblogic-cafe/target/weblogic-cafe.war*. If you don't see the package, you must troubleshoot and resolve the issue before you continue.

### Use Docker to create an auxiliary image

The steps in this section show you how to build an auxiliary image. This image includes the following components:

- The *Model in Image* model files
- Your application
- The JDBC driver archive file
- The WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation

An *auxiliary image* is a Docker container image containing your app and configuration. The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator combines your auxiliary image with the `domain.spec.image` in the AKS cluster that contains the WebLogic Server, JDK, and operating system. For more information about auxiliary images, see [Auxiliary images](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/managing-domains/model-in-image/auxiliary-images/) in the Oracle documentation.

This section requires a Linux terminal with Azure CLI and kubectl installed.

Use the following steps to build the image:

1. Use the following commands to create a directory to stage the models and application:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models
   cd ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models
   ```

1. Copy the **shellCmdtoOutputWlsImageModelYaml** value that you saved from the deployment outputs, paste it into the Bash window, and run the command. The command should look similar to the following example:

   ```bash
   echo -e IyBDb3B5cmlna...Cgo= | base64 -d > model.yaml
   ```

   This command produces a *${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/model.yaml* file with contents similar to the following example:

   ```yaml

     AdminPassword: "@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:password@@"
     ServerStartMode: "prod"

   topology:
     Name: "@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@"
     ProductionModeEnabled: true
     AdminServerName: "admin-server"
     Cluster:
       "cluster-1":
         DynamicServers:
           ServerTemplate: "cluster-1-template"
           ServerNamePrefix: "@@ENV:MANAGED_SERVER_PREFIX@@"
           DynamicClusterSize: "@@PROP:CLUSTER_SIZE@@"
           MaxDynamicClusterSize: "@@PROP:CLUSTER_SIZE@@"
           MinDynamicClusterSize: "0"
           CalculatedListenPorts: false
     Server:
       "admin-server":
         ListenPort: 7001
     ServerTemplate:
       "cluster-1-template":
         Cluster: "cluster-1"
         ListenPort: 8001
     SecurityConfiguration:
       NodeManagerUsername: "@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:username@@"
       NodeManagerPasswordEncrypted: "@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:password@@"

   resources:
     SelfTuning:
       MinThreadsConstraint:
         SampleMinThreads:
           Target: "cluster-1"
           Count: 1
       MaxThreadsConstraint:
         SampleMaxThreads:
           Target: "cluster-1"
           Count: 10
       WorkManager:

           Target: "cluster-1"
           MinThreadsConstraint: "SampleMinThreads"
           MaxThreadsConstraint: "SampleMaxThreads"
   ```

1. In a similar way, copy the **shellCmdtoOutputWlsImageProperties** value, paste it into the Bash window, and run the command. The command should look similar to the following example:

   ```bash
   echo -e IyBDb3B5cml...pFPTUK | base64 -d > model.properties
   ```

   This command produces a *${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/model.properties* file with contents similar to the following example:

   ```properties
   # Copyright (c) 2021, Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates.
   # Licensed under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 as shown at https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl.

   # Based on ./kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v1/model.10.properties
   # in https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.

   CLUSTER_SIZE=5
   ```

1. Use the following steps to create the application model file.

   1. Use the following commands to copy *weblogic-cafe.war* and save it to *wlsdeploy/applications*:

      ```bash
      mkdir -p ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/wlsdeploy/applications
      cp $BASE_DIR/weblogic-on-azure/javaee/weblogic-cafe/target/weblogic-cafe.war ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/wlsdeploy/applications/weblogic-cafe.war
      ```

   1. Use the following commands to create the application model file with the contents shown. Save the model file to *${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/appmodel.yaml*.

      ```bash
      cat <<EOF >appmodel.yaml
      appDeployments:
        Application:
          weblogic-cafe:
            SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/weblogic-cafe.war'
            ModuleType: ear
            Target: 'cluster-1'
      EOF
      ```

1. Use the following commands to download and install Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver to *wlsdeploy/externalJDBCLibraries*:

   ```bash
   export DRIVER_VERSION="10.2.1.jre8"
   export MSSQL_DRIVER_URL="https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/microsoft/sqlserver/mssql-jdbc/${DRIVER_VERSION}/mssql-jdbc-${DRIVER_VERSION}.jar"

   mkdir ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/wlsdeploy/externalJDBCLibraries
   curl -m 120 -fL ${MSSQL_DRIVER_URL} -o ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/wlsdeploy/externalJDBCLibraries/mssql-jdbc-${DRIVER_VERSION}.jar
   ```

1. Next, use the following commands to create the database connection model file with the contents shown. Save the model file to *${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models/dbmodel.yaml*. The model uses placeholders (secret `sqlserver-secret`) for database username, password, and URL. Make sure the following fields are set correctly. The following model names the resource with `jdbc/WebLogicCafeDB`.

   | Item Name         | Field                                                                                     | Value                                          |
   |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
   | JNDI name         | `resources.JDBCSystemResource.<resource-name>.JdbcResource.JDBCDataSourceParams.JNDIName` | `jdbc/WebLogicCafeDB`                          |
   | Driver name       | `resources.JDBCSystemResource.<resource-name>.JDBCDriverParams.DriverName`                | `com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver` |
   | Database Url      | `resources.JDBCSystemResource.<resource-name>.JDBCDriverParams.URL`                       | `@@SECRET:sqlserver-secret:url@@`              |
   | Database password | `resources.JDBCSystemResource.<resource-name>.JDBCDriverParams.PasswordEncrypted`         | `@@SECRET:sqlserver-secret:password@@`         |
   | Database username | `resources.JDBCSystemResource.<resource-name>.JDBCDriverParams.Properties.user.Value`     | `'@@SECRET:sqlserver-secret:user@@'`           |

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF >dbmodel.yaml
   resources:
     JDBCSystemResource:
       jdbc/WebLogicCafeDB:
         Target: 'cluster-1'
         JdbcResource:
           JDBCDataSourceParams:
             JNDIName: [
               jdbc/WebLogicCafeDB
             ]
             GlobalTransactionsProtocol: None
           JDBCDriverParams:
             DriverName: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
             URL: '@@SECRET:sqlserver-secret:url@@'
             PasswordEncrypted: '@@SECRET:sqlserver-secret:password@@'
             Properties:
               user:
                 Value: '@@SECRET:sqlserver-secret:user@@'
           JDBCConnectionPoolParams:
             TestTableName: SQL SELECT 1
             TestConnectionsOnReserve: true
   EOF
   ```

1. Use the following commands to create an application archive file and then remove the *wlsdeploy* folder, which you don't need anymore:

   ```bash
   cd ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/models
   zip -r archive.zip wlsdeploy

   rm -f -r wlsdeploy
   ```

1. Use the following commands to download and install [WebLogic Deploy Tooling](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-deploy-tooling/) (WDT) in the staging directory and remove its *weblogic-deploy/bin/\*.cmd* files, which aren't used in UNIX environments:

   ```bash
   cd ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging
   curl -m 120 -fL https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/latest/download/weblogic-deploy.zip -o weblogic-deploy.zip

   unzip weblogic-deploy.zip -d .
   rm ./weblogic-deploy/bin/*.cmd
   ```

1. Use the following command to remove the WDT installer:

   ```bash
   rm weblogic-deploy.zip
   ```

1. Use the following commands to build an auxiliary image using docker:

   ```bash
   cd ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging
   cat <<EOF >Dockerfile
   FROM busybox
   ARG AUXILIARY_IMAGE_PATH=/auxiliary
   ARG USER=oracle
   ARG USERID=1000
   ARG GROUP=root
   ENV AUXILIARY_IMAGE_PATH=\${AUXILIARY_IMAGE_PATH}
   RUN adduser -D -u \${USERID} -G \$GROUP \$USER
   # ARG expansion in COPY command's --chown is available in docker version 19.03.1+.
   # For older docker versions, change the Dockerfile to use separate COPY and 'RUN chown' commands.
   COPY --chown=\$USER:\$GROUP ./ \${AUXILIARY_IMAGE_PATH}/
   USER \$USER
   EOF
   ```

1. Run the `docker buildx build` command using *${BASE_DIR}/mystaging/Dockerfile*, as shown in the following example:

   ```bash
   cd ${BASE_DIR}/mystaging
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg AUXILIARY_IMAGE_PATH=/auxiliary --tag model-in-image:WLS-v1 .
   ```

   When you build the image successfully, the output looks similar to the following example:

   ```output

   ```

1. If you have successfully created the image, then it should now be in your local machine's Docker repository. You can verify the image creation by using the following command:

   ```text
   docker images model-in-image:WLS-v1
   ```

   This command should produce output similar to the following example:

   ```output
   REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
   model-in-image   WLS-v1    76abc1afdcc6   2 hours ago   8.61MB
   ```

   After the image is created, it should have the WDT executables in */auxiliary/weblogic-deploy*, and WDT model, property, and archive files in */auxiliary/models*. Use the following command on the Docker image to verify this result:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm model-in-image:WLS-v1 find /auxiliary -maxdepth 2 -type f -print
   ```

   This command should produce output similar to the following example:

   ```output
   /auxiliary/models/model.properties
   /auxiliary/models/dbmodel.yaml
   /auxiliary/models/model.yaml
   /auxiliary/models/archive.zip
   /auxiliary/models/appmodel.yaml
   /auxiliary/Dockerfile
   /auxiliary/weblogic-deploy/LICENSE.txt
   /auxiliary/weblogic-deploy/VERSION.txt
   ```

1. Use the following steps to push the auxiliary image to Azure Container Registry:

   1. Open the Azure portal and go to the resource group that you provisioned in the [Deploy WSL on AKS](#deploy-wls-on-aks) section.
   1. Select the resource of type **Container registry** from the resource list.
   1. Hover the mouse over the value next to **Login server** and select the copy icon next to the text.
   1. Save the value in the `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER` environment variable by using the following command:

      ```bash
      export ACR_LOGIN_SERVER=<value-from-clipboard>
      ```

   1. Run the following commands to tag and push the image. Make sure Docker is running before executing these commands.

      ```bash
      export ACR_NAME=$(echo ${ACR_LOGIN_SERVER} | cut -d '.' -f 1)
      az acr login -n $ACR_NAME
      docker tag model-in-image:WLS-v1 $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/wlsaks-auxiliary-image:1.0
      docker push $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/wlsaks-auxiliary-image:1.0
      ```

   1. You can run `az acr repository show` to test whether the image is pushed to the remote repository successfully, as shown in the following example:

      ```bash
      az acr repository show --name ${ACR_NAME} --image wlsaks-auxiliary-image:1.0
      ```

      This command should produce output similar to the following example:

      ```output
      {
        "changeableAttributes": {
          "deleteEnabled": true,
          "listEnabled": true,
          "readEnabled": true,
          "writeEnabled": true
        },
        "createdTime": "2024-01-24T06:14:19.4546321Z",
        "digest": "sha256:a1befbefd0181a06c6fe00848e76f1743c1fecba2b42a975e9504ba2aaae51ea",
        "lastUpdateTime": "2024-01-24T06:14:19.4546321Z",
        "name": "1.0",
        "quarantineState": "Passed",
        "signed": false
      }
      ```

### Apply the auxiliary image

In the previous steps, you created the auxiliary image including models and WDT. Before you apply the auxiliary image to the WLS cluster, use the following steps to create the secret for the datasource URL, username, and password. The secret is used as part of the placeholder in the *dbmodel.yaml*.

1. Connect to the AKS cluster by copying the **shellCmdtoConnectAks** value that you saved aside previously, pasting it into the Bash window, then running the command. The command should look similar to the following example:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <subscription>; 
   az aks get-credentials \
       --resource-group <resource-group> \
       --name <name>
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following example. If you don't see this output, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before continuing.

   ```output
   Merged "<name>" as current context in /Users/<username>/.kube/config
   ```

1. Use the following steps to get values for the variables shown in the following table. You use these values later to create the secret for the datasource connection.

   | Variable               | Description                                | Example                                                                                       |
   |------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` | The connection string of SQL server.       | `jdbc:sqlserver://server-name.database.windows.net:1433;database=wlsaksquickstart0125` |
   | `DB_USER`              | The username to sign in to the SQL server. | `welogic@sqlserverforwlsaks`                                                                  |
   | `DB_PASSWORD`          | The password to sign in to the sQL server. | `Secret123456`                                                                                |

   1. Visit the SQL database resource in the Azure portal.

   1. In the navigation pane, under **Settings**, select **Connection strings**.

   1. Select the **JDBC** tab.

   1. Select the copy icon to copy the connection string to the clipboard.

   1. For `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`, use the entire connection string, but replace the placeholder `{your_password_here}` with your database password.

   1. For `DB_USER`, use the portion of the connection string from `azureuser` up to but not including `;password={your_password_here}`.

   1. For `DB_PASSWORD`, use the value you entered when you created the database.

1. Use the following commands to create the [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). This article uses the secret name `sqlserver-secret` for the secret of the datasource connection. If you use a different name, make sure the value is the same as the one in *dbmodel.yaml*.

   In the following commands, be sure to set the variables `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` correctly by replacing the placeholder examples with the values described in the previous steps. Be sure to enclose the value of the `DB_` variables in single quotes to prevent the shell from interfering with the values.

   ```bash
   export DB_CONNECTION_STRING='<example-jdbc:sqlserver://server-name.database.windows.net:1433;database=wlsaksquickstart0125>'
   export DB_USER='<example-welogic@sqlserverforwlsaks>'
   export DB_PASSWORD='<example-Secret123456>'
   export WLS_DOMAIN_NS=sample-domain1-ns
   export WLS_DOMAIN_UID=sample-domain1
   export SECRET_NAME=sqlserver-secret

   kubectl -n ${WLS_DOMAIN_NS} create secret generic \
       ${SECRET_NAME} \
       --from-literal=password="${DB_PASSWORD}" \
       --from-literal=url="${DB_CONNECTION_STRING}" \
       --from-literal=user="${DB_USER}"

   kubectl -n ${WLS_DOMAIN_NS} label secret \
       ${SECRET_NAME} \
       weblogic.domainUID=${WLS_DOMAIN_UID}
   ```

   You must see the following output before you continue. If you don't see this output, troubleshoot and resolve the problem before you continue.

   ```output
   secret/sqlserver-secret created
   secret/sqlserver-secret labeled
   ```

1. Apply the auxiliary image by patching the domain custom resource definition (CRD) using the `kubectl patch` command.

   The auxiliary image is defined in `spec.configuration.model.auxiliaryImages`, as shown in the following example. For more information, see [auxiliary images](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/managing-domains/model-in-image/auxiliary-images/).

   ```yaml
   spec:
     clusters:
     - name: sample-domain1-cluster-1
     configuration:
       model:
         auxiliaryImages:
         - image: wlsaksacrafvzeyyswhxek.azurecr.io/wlsaks-auxiliary-image:1.0
           imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
           sourceModelHome: /auxiliary/models
           sourceWDTInstallHome: /auxiliary/weblogic-deploy
   ```

   Use the following commands to increase the `restartVersion` value and use `kubectl patch` to apply the auxiliary image to the domain CRD using the definition shown:

   ```bash
   export VERSION=$(kubectl -n ${WLS_DOMAIN_NS} get domain ${WLS_DOMAIN_UID} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.restartVersion}' | tr -d "\"")
   export VERSION=$((VERSION+1))

   cat <<EOF >patch-file.json
   [
     {
       "op": "replace",
       "path": "/spec/restartVersion",
       "value": "${VERSION}"
     },
     {
       "op": "add",
       "path": "/spec/configuration/model/auxiliaryImages",
       "value": [{"image": "$ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/wlsaks-auxiliary-image:1.0", "imagePullPolicy": "IfNotPresent", "sourceModelHome": "/auxiliary/models", "sourceWDTInstallHome": "/auxiliary/weblogic-deploy"}]
     },
     {
       "op": "add",
       "path": "/spec/configuration/secrets",
       "value": ["${SECRET_NAME}"]
     }
   ]
   EOF

   kubectl -n ${WLS_DOMAIN_NS} patch domain ${WLS_DOMAIN_UID} \
       --type=json \
       --patch-file patch-file.json

   kubectl get pod -n ${WLS_DOMAIN_NS} -w
   ```

1. Wait until the admin server and managed servers show the values in the following output block before you proceed:

   ```output
   NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   sample-domain1-admin-server      1/1     Running   0          20m
   sample-domain1-managed-server1   1/1     Running   0          19m
   sample-domain1-managed-server2   1/1     Running   0          18m
   ```

   It might take 5-10 minutes for the system to reach this state. The following list provides an overview of what's happening while you wait:

   - You should see the `sample-domain1-introspector` running first. This software looks for changes to the domain custom resource so it can take the necessary actions on the Kubernetes cluster.
   - When changes are detected, the domain introspector kills and starts new pods to roll out the changes.
   - Next, you should see the `sample-domain1-admin-server` pod terminate and restart.
   - Then, you should see the two managed servers terminate and restart.
   - Only when all three pods show the `1/1 Running` state, is it ok to proceed.

## Verify the functionality of the deployment

Use the following steps to verify the functionality of the deployment by viewing the WLS admin console and the sample app:

1. Paste the **adminConsoleExternalUrl** value into the address bar of an Internet-connected web browser. You should see the familiar WLS admin console login screen.

1. Sign in with the username `weblogic` and the password you entered when deploying WLS from the Azure portal. Recall that this value is `wlsAksCluster2022`.

1. In the **Domain Structure** box, select **Services**.

1. Under the **Services**, select **Data Sources**.

1. In the **Summary of JDBC Data Sources** panel, select **Monitoring**. Your screen should look similar to the following example. You find the state of data source is running on managed servers.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/datasource-state.png" alt-text="Screenshot of data source state." border="false":::

1. In the **Domain Structure** box, select **Deployments**.

1. In the **Deployments** table, there should be one row. The name should be the same value as the `Application` value in your *appmodel.yaml* file. Select the name.

1. In the **Settings** panel, select the **Testing** tab.

1. Select **weblogic-cafe**.

1. In the **Settings for weblogic-cafe** panel, select the **Testing** tab.

1. Expand the **+** icon next to **weblogic-cafe**. Your screen should look similar to the following example. In particular, you should see values similar to `http://sample-domain1-managed-server1:8001/weblogic-cafe/index.xhtml` in the **Test Point** column.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/weblogic-cafe-deployment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of weblogic-cafe test points." border="false":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > The hyperlinks in the **Test Point** column are not selectable because we did not configure the admin console with the external URL on which it is running. This article shows the WLS admin console merely by way of demonstration. Don't use the WLS admin console for any durable configuration changes when running WLS on AKS. The cloud-native design of WLS on AKS requires that any durable configuration must be represented in the initial docker images or applied to the running AKS cluster using CI/CD techniques such as updating the model, as described in the [Oracle documentation](https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs-update-model).

1. Understand the `context-path` value of the sample app you deployed. If you deployed the recommended sample app, the `context-path` is `weblogic-cafe`.
1. Construct a fully qualified URL for the sample app by appending the `context-path` to the **clusterExternalUrl** value. If you deployed the recommended sample app, the fully qualified URL should be something like `http://wlsgw202401-wls-aks-domain1.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/weblogic-cafe/`.
1. Paste the fully qualified URL in an Internet-connected web browser. If you deployed the recommended sample app, you should see results similar to the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-deploy-java-wls-app/weblogic-cafe-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of test web app." border="false":::

## Clean up resources

To avoid Azure charges, you should clean up unnecessary resources. When you no longer need the cluster, use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command. The following command removes the resource group, container service, container registry, and all related resources:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <resource-group-name> --yes --no-wait
az group delete --name <db-resource-group-name> --yes --no-wait
```
