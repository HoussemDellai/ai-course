# Use a static public IP address and DNS label with the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) load balancer

When you create a load balancer resource in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, the public IP address assigned to it is only valid for the lifespan of that resource. If you delete the Kubernetes service, the associated load balancer and IP address are also deleted. If you want to assign a specific IP address or retain an IP address for redeployed Kubernetes services, you can create and use a static public IP address.

This article shows you how to create a static public IP address and assign it to your Kubernetes service.

## Before you begin

* You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].
* This article covers using a *Standard* SKU IP with a *Standard* SKU load balancer. For more information, see [IP address types and allocation methods in Azure][ip-sku].

## Create an AKS cluster

1. Create an Azure resource group using the [`az group create`][az-group-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --name myNetworkResourceGroup --location eastus
    ```

2. Create an AKS cluster using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myNetworkResourceGroup --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

## Create a static IP address

1. Get the name of the node resource group using the [`az aks show`][az-aks-show] command and query for the `nodeResourceGroup` property.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myNetworkResourceGroup --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv
    ```

2. Create a static public IP address in the node resource group using the [`az network public ip create`][az-network-public-ip-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network public-ip create \
        --resource-group <node resource group name> \
        --name myAKSPublicIP \
        --sku Standard \
        --allocation-method static
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're using a *Basic* SKU load balancer in your AKS cluster, use *Basic* for the `--sku` parameter when defining a public IP. Only *Basic* SKU IPs work with the *Basic* SKU load balancer and only *Standard* SKU IPs work with *Standard* SKU load balancers.

2. Get the static public IP address using the [`az network public-ip list`][az-network-public-ip-list] command. Specify the name of the node resource group and public IP address you created, and query for the `ipAddress`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network public-ip show --resource-group <node resource group name> --name myAKSPublicIP --query ipAddress --output tsv
    ```

## Create a service using the static IP address

1. First, determine which type of managed identity your AKS cluster is using, system-assigned or user-assigned. If you're not certain, call the [az aks show][az-aks-show] command and query for the identity's *type* property.

    ```azurecli
    az aks show \
        --name myAKSCluster \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --query identity.type \
        --output tsv       
    ```

    If the cluster is using a managed identity, the value of the *type* property will be either **SystemAssigned** or **UserAssigned**.

    If the cluster is using a service principal, the value of the *type* property will be null. Consider upgrading your cluster to use a managed identity.

1. If your AKS cluster uses a system-assigned managed identity, then query for the managed identity's principal ID as follows:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Get the principal ID for a system-assigned managed identity.
    CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show \
        --name myAKSCluster \
        --resource-group myNetworkResourceGroup \
        --query identity.principalId \
        --output tsv)
    ```

    If your AKS cluster uses a user-assigned managed identity, then the principal ID will be null. Query for the user-assigned managed identity's client ID instead:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Get the client ID for a user-assigned managed identity.
    CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show \
        --name myAKSCluster \
        --resource-group myNetworkResourceGroup \
        --query identity.userAssignedIdentities.*.clientId \
        --output tsv    
    ```

1. Assign delegated permissions for the managed identity used by the AKS cluster for the public IP's resource group by calling the [`az role assignment create`][az-role-assignment-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Get the resource ID for the node resource group.
    RG_SCOPE=$(az group show \
        --name <node resource group> \
        --query id \
        --output tsv)

    # Assign the Network Contributor role to the managed identity,
    # scoped to the node resource group.
    az role assignment create \
        --assignee ${CLIENT_ID} \
        --role "Network Contributor" \
        --scope ${RG_SCOPE}
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you customized your outbound IP, make sure your cluster identity has permissions to both the outbound public IP and the inbound public IP.

1. Create a file named `load-balancer-service.yaml` and copy in the contents of the following YAML file, providing your own public IP address created in the previous step and the node resource group name.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Adding the `loadBalancerIP` property to the load balancer YAML manifest is deprecating following [upstream Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235). While current usage remains the same and existing services are expected to work without modification, we **highly recommend setting service annotations** instead. To set service annotations, you can either use `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name` for public IP name, or use `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv4` for an IPv4 address and `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-ipv6` for an IPv6 address, as shown in the example YAML.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group: <node resource group name>
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name: myAKSPublicIP
      name: azure-load-balancer
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
      selector:
        app: azure-load-balancer
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Adding the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name` annotation ensures the most efficient LoadBalancer creation and is highly recommended to avoid potential throttling. 

1. Set a public-facing DNS label to the service using the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name` service annotation. This publishes a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your service using Azure's public DNS servers and top-level domain. The annotation value must be unique within the Azure location, so we recommend you use a sufficiently qualified label. Azure automatically appends a default suffix in the location you selected, such as `<location>.cloudapp.azure.com`, to the name you provide, creating the FQDN.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to publish the service on your own domain, see [Azure DNS][azure-dns-zone] and the [external-dns][external-dns] project.
  
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group: <node resource group name>
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-pip-name: myAKSPublicIP
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: <unique-service-label>
      name: azure-load-balancer
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
      selector:
        app: azure-load-balancer
    ```

1. Create the service and deployment using the `kubectl apply` command.

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f load-balancer-service.yaml
    ```

1. To see the DNS label for your load balancer, use the `kubectl describe service` command.

    ```console
    kubectl describe service azure-load-balancer
    ```

    The DNS label will be listed under the `Annotations`, as shown in the following condensed example output:

    ```output
    Name:                    azure-load-balancer
    Namespace:               default
    Labels:                  <none>
    Annotations:             service.beta.kuberenetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: <unique-service-label>
    ```

## Troubleshoot

If the static IP address defined in the `loadBalancerIP` property of the Kubernetes service manifest doesn't exist or hasn't been created in the node resource group and there are no other delegations configured, the load balancer service creation fails. To troubleshoot, review the service creation events using the [`kubectl describe`][kubectl-describe] command. Provide the name of the service specified in the YAML manifest, as shown in the following example:

```console
kubectl describe service azure-load-balancer
```

The output shows you information about the Kubernetes service resource. The following example output shows a `Warning` in the `Events`: "`user supplied IP address was not found`." In this scenario, make sure you created the static public IP address in the node resource group and that the IP address specified in the Kubernetes service manifest is correct.

```output

Namespace:                default
