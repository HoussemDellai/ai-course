# Integrations with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on for AKS integrates with features provided by Azure and open-source projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy] doesn't cover integrations with open-source projects.

## Observe your autoscaling with Kubernetes events

KEDA automatically emits Kubernetes events allowing customers to operate their application autoscaling.

To learn about the available metrics, we recommend reading the [KEDA documentation][keda-event-docs].

## Scalers for Azure services

KEDA can integrate with various tools and services through [a rich catalog of Azure KEDA scalers][keda-scalers] and supports leading cloud platforms and open-source technologies.

KEDA leverages the following scalers for Azure services:

- [Azure Application Insights](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-app-insights/)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-storage-blob/)
- [Azure Data Explorer](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-data-explorer/)
- [Azure Event Hubs](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-event-hub/)
- [Azure Log Analytics](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-log-analytics/)
- [Azure Monitor](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-monitor/)
- [Azure Pipelines](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-pipelines/)
- [Azure Service Bus](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-service-bus/)
- [Azure Storage Queue](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-storage-queue/)

As of KEDA version `2.10`, the [Prometheus scaler][prometheus-scaler] supports Azure managed service for Prometheus.

You can also install external scalers to autoscale on other Azure services:
- [Azure Cosmos DB (Change feed)](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> External scalers *aren't supported as part of the add-on* and rely on community support.
