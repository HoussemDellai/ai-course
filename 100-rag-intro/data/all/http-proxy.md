# HTTP proxy support in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this article, you learn how to configure Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to use an HTTP proxy for outbound internet access.

AKS clusters deployed into managed or custom virtual networks have certain outbound dependencies that are necessary to function properly, which created problems in environments requiring internet access to be routed through HTTP proxies. Nodes had no way of bootstrapping the configuration, environment variables, and certificates necessary to access internet services.

The HTTP proxy feature adds HTTP proxy support to AKS clusters, exposing a straightforward interface that you can use to secure AKS-required network traffic in proxy-dependent environments. With this feature, both AKS nodes and pods are configured to use the HTTP proxy. The feature also enables installation of a trusted certificate authority onto the nodes as part of bootstrapping a cluster. More complex solutions might require creating a chain of trust to establish secure communications across the network.

## Limitations and considerations

The following scenarios are **not** supported:

* Different proxy configurations per node pool
* User/Password authentication
* Custom certificate authorities (CAs) for API server communication
* Windows-based clusters
* Node pools using Virtual Machine Availability Sets (VMAS)
* Using * as wildcard attached to a domain suffix for noProxy

`httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `trustedCa` have no value by default. Pods are injected with the following environment variables:

* `HTTP_PROXY`
* `http_proxy`
* `HTTPS_PROXY`
* `https_proxy`
* `NO_PROXY`
* `no_proxy`

To disable the injection of the proxy environment variables, you need to annotate the Pod with `"kubernetes.azure.com/no-http-proxy-vars":"true"`.

## Before you begin

* You need the latest version of the Azure CLI. Run `az --version` to find the version, and run `az upgrade` to upgrade the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].
* [Check for available AKS cluster upgrades](./upgrade-aks-cluster.md#check-for-available-aks-cluster-upgrades) to ensure you're running the latest version of AKS. If you need to upgrade, see [Upgrade an AKS cluster](./upgrade-aks-cluster.md#upgrade-an-aks-cluster).
* The OS files required for proxy configuration updates can only be updated during the node image upgrade process. After configuring the proxy, you must upgrade the node image to apply the changes. For more information, see [Upgrade AKS node images](#upgrade-aks-node-images).

## Configure an HTTP proxy using the Azure CLI

You can configure an AKS cluster with an HTTP proxy during cluster creation using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command and passing in configuration as a JSON file.

The schema for the config file looks like this:

```json
{
  "httpProxy": "string",
  "httpsProxy": "string",
  "noProxy": [
    "string"
  ],
  "trustedCa": "string"
}
```

* `httpProxy`: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be `http`.
* `httpsProxy`: A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. If not specified, then `httpProxy` is used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections.
* `noProxy`: A list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude proxying.
* `trustedCa`: A string containing the `base64 encoded` alternative CA certificate content. Currently only the `PEM` format is supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For compatibility with Go-based components that are part of the Kubernetes system, the certificate **must** support `Subject Alternative Names(SANs)` instead of the deprecated Common Name certs.
>
> There are differences in applications on how to comply with the environment variable `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy`. Curl and Python don't support CIDR in `no_proxy`, but Ruby does.

Example input:

> [!NOTE]
> The CA certificate should be the base64 encoded string of the PEM format cert content.

```json
{
  "httpProxy": "http://myproxy.server.com:8080/", 
  "httpsProxy": "https://myproxy.server.com:8080/", 
  "noProxy": [
    "localhost",
    "127.0.0.1"
  ],
  "trustedCA": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSUgvVENDQmVXZ0F3SUJB...b3Rpbk15RGszaWFyCkYxMFlscWNPbWVYMXVGbUtiZGkvWG9yR2xrQ29NRjNURHg4cm1wOURCaUIvCi0tLS0tRU5EIENFUlRJRklDQVRFLS0tLS0="
}
```

Create a file and provide values for `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy`. If your environment requires it, provide a value for `trustedCa`. Next, you can deploy the cluster using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command with the `--http-proxy-config` parameter set to the file you created. Your cluster should initialize with the HTTP proxy configured on the nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create \
    --name $clusterName \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --http-proxy-config aks-proxy-config.json \
    --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Configure an HTTP proxy using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

You can deploy an AKS cluster with an HTTP proxy using an ARM template. The same schema used for CLI deployment exists in the `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters` definition under `"properties"`, as shown in the following example:

```json
"properties": {
    ...,
    "httpProxyConfig": {
        "httpProxy": "string",
        "httpsProxy": "string",
        "noProxy": [
            "string"
        ],
        "trustedCa": "string"
    }
}
```

In your template, provide values for `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, and `noProxy`. If necessary, provide a value for `trustedCa`. Next, you can deploy the template. Your cluster should initialize with your HTTP proxy configured on the nodes.

## Update proxy configuration

> [!NOTE]
> If switching to a new proxy, the new proxy must already exist for the update to be successful. After the upgrade is completed, you can delete the old proxy.

You can update the proxy configuration on your cluster using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command with the `--http-proxy-config` parameter set to a new JSON file with updated values for `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, `noProxy`, and `trustedCa` if necessary. The update injects new environment variables into pods with the new `httpProxy`, `httpsProxy`, or `noProxy` values. Pods must be rotated for the apps to pick it up, because the environment variable values are injected by a mutating admission webhook. For components under Kubernetes, like containerd and the node itself, this doesn't take effect until a node image upgrade is performed.

For example, let's say you created a new file with the base64 encoded string of the new CA cert called *aks-proxy-config-2.json*. You can update the proxy configuration on your cluster with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update --name $clusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup --http-proxy-config aks-proxy-config-2.json
```

## Upgrade AKS node images

After configuring the proxy, you must upgrade the node image to apply the changes. The node image upgrade process is the only way to update the OS files required for proxy configuration updates. The node image upgrade process is a rolling upgrade that updates the OS image on each node in the node pool. The AKS control plane handles the upgrade process, which is nondisruptive to running applications.

To upgrade AKS node images, see [Upgrade Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node images](./node-image-upgrade.md).

## Monitoring add-on configuration

HTTP proxy with the monitoring add-on supports the following configurations:

* Outbound proxy without authentication
* Outbound proxy with username & password authentication
* Outbound proxy with trusted cert for Log Analytics endpoint

The following configurations aren't supported:

* Custom Metrics and Recommended Alerts features when using a proxy with trusted certificates
