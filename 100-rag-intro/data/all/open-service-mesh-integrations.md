# Integrations with Open Service Mesh on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The Open Service Mesh (OSM) add-on integrates with features provided by Azure and some open source projects.

> [!NOTE]
> With the retirement of [Open Service Mesh (OSM)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), we recommend identifying your OSM configurations and migrating them to an equivalent Istio configuration. For information about migrating from OSM to Istio, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrations with open source projects aren't covered by the [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy].

## Ingress

Ingress allows for traffic external to the mesh to be routed to services within the mesh. With OSM, you can configure most ingress solutions to work with your mesh, but OSM works best with one of the following solutions:

* [Application Routing][app-routing]
* [NGINX ingress][osm-nginx]
* [Contour ingress][osm-contour]

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, [Azure Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)][agic] only works for HTTP backends. If you configure OSM to use AGIC, AGIC won't be used for other backends, such as HTTPS and mTLS.

### Use the Azure Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) with the OSM add-on for HTTP ingress

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't configure [Azure Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC)][agic] for HTTPS ingress.

#### Create a namespace and deploy the application service

1. Installing the AGIC ingress controller.
2. Create a namespace for the application service using the `kubectl create ns` command.

    ```console
    kubectl create ns httpbin
    ```

3. Add the namespace to the mesh using the `osm namespace add` OSM CLI command.

    ```console
    osm namespace add httpbin
    ```

4. Deploy the application service to the namespace using the `kubectl apply` command.

    ```console
    export RELEASE_BRANCH=release-v1.2
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openservicemesh/osm-docs/$RELEASE_BRANCH/manifests/samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml -n httpbin
    ```

5. Verify the pods are up and running and have the envoy sidecar injected using the `kubectl get pods` command.

    ```console
    kubectl get pods -n httpbin
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    httpbin-7c6464475-9wrr8   2/2     Running   0          6d20h
    ```

6. List the details of the service using the `kubectl get svc` command.

    ```console
    kubectl get svc -n httpbin
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
    httpbin   ClusterIP   10.0.92.135   <none>        14001/TCP   6d20h
    ```

#### Deploy the ingress configurations and verify access to the application service

1. Deploy the following `Ingress` and `IngressBackend` configurations to allow external clients to access the `httpbin` service on port `14001` using the `kubectl apply` command.

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f <<EOF
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: httpbin
      namespace: httpbin
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway
    spec:
      rules:
     - http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: httpbin
                port:
                  number: 14001
    ---
    kind: IngressBackend
    apiVersion: policy.openservicemesh.io/v1alpha1
    metadata:
      name: httpbin
      namespace: httpbin
    spec:
      backends:
     - name: httpbin
        port:
          number: 14001 # targetPort of httpbin service
          protocol: http
      sources:
     - kind: IPRange
        name: 10.0.0.0/8
    EOF
    ```

2. Verify the `Ingress` object was successfully deployed using the `kubectl get ingress` command and make note of the external IP address.

    ```console
    kubectl get ingress -n httpbin
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME      CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
    httpbin   <none>   *       20.85.173.179   80      6d20h
    ```

3. Verify the `IngressBackend` object was successfully deployed using the `kubectl get ingressbackend` command.

    ```console
    kubectl get ingressbackend -n httpbin
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME      STATUS
    httpbin   committed
    ```

4. Verify you can access the `httpbin` service using the external IP address of the ingress service and the following `curl` command.

    ```console
    curl -sI http://<external-ip>/get
    ```

5. Confirm you receive a response with `status 200`.

## Metrics observability

Metrics observability allows you to view the metrics of your mesh and the deployments in your mesh. With OSM, you can use [Prometheus and Grafana][osm-metrics] for metrics observability, but those integrations aren't covered by the [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy].

You can also integrate OSM with [Azure Monitor][azure-monitor].

Before you can enable metrics on your mesh to integrate with Azure Monitor, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* Enable Azure Monitor on your cluster.
* Enable the OSM add-on for your AKS cluster.
* Onboard your application namespaces to the mesh.

1. Enable metrics for a namespace in the mesh using the `osm metrics enable` command.

    ```console
    osm metrics enable --namespace myappnamespace
    ```

2. Create a ConfigMap in the `kube-system` namespace that enables Azure Monitor to monitor your namespaces. For example, create a `monitor-configmap.yaml` with the following contents to monitor the `myappnamespace`:

    ```yaml
    kind: ConfigMap
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      schema-version: v1
      config-version: ver1
      osm-metric-collection-configuration: |-
        # OSM metric collection settings
        [osm_metric_collection_configuration]
          [osm_metric_collection_configuration.settings]
              # Namespaces to monitor
              monitor_namespaces = ["myappnamespace"]
    metadata:
      name: container-azm-ms-osmconfig
      namespace: kube-system
    ```

3. Apply the ConfigMap using the `kubectl apply` command.

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f monitor-configmap.yaml
    ```

4. Navigate to the Azure portal and select your AKS cluster.
5. Under **Monitoring**, select **Logs**.
6. In the **Monitoring** section, query the `InsightsMetrics` table to view metrics in the enabled namespaces. For example, the following query shows the *envoy* metrics for the *default* namespace:

    ```sh
    InsightsMetrics
    |     where Name contains "envoy"
    |     extend t=parse_json(Tags)
    |     where t.namespace == "default"
    ```

## Automation and developer tools

OSM can integrate with certain automation projects and developer tooling to help operators and developers build and release applications. For example, OSM integrates with [Flagger][osm-flagger] for progressive delivery and [Dapr][osm-dapr] for building applications. The OSM integrations with Flagger and Dapr aren't covered by the [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy].

## External authorization

External authorization allows you to offload authorization of HTTP requests to an external service. OSM can use external authorization by integrating with [Open Policy Agent (OPA)][osm-opa], but that integration isn't covered by the [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy].

## Certificate management

OSM has several types of certificates it uses to operate on your AKS cluster. OSM includes its own certificate manager called [Tresor][osm-tresor], which is used by default. Alternatively, OSM allows you to integrate with [Hashicorp Vault][osm-hashi-vault] and [cert-manager][osm-cert-manager], but those integrations aren't covered by the [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy].
