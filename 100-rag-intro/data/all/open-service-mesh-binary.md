# Download and configure the Open Service Mesh (OSM) client library

This article will discuss how to download the OSM client library to be used to operate and configure the OSM add-on for AKS, and how to configure the binary for your environment.

> [!NOTE]
> With the retirement of [Open Service Mesh (OSM)](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/) by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), we recommend identifying your OSM configurations and migrating them to an equivalent Istio configuration. For information about migrating from OSM to Istio, see [Migration guidance for Open Service Mesh (OSM) configurations to Istio](open-service-mesh-istio-migration-guidance.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Based on the version of Kubernetes your cluster is running, the OSM add-on installs a different version of OSM.
>
> |Kubernetes version         | OSM version installed |
> |---------------------------|-----------------------|
> | 1.24.0 or greater         | 1.2.5                 |
> | Between 1.23.5 and 1.24.0 | 1.1.3                 |
> | Below 1.23.5              | 1.0.0                 |
>
> Older versions of OSM may not be available for install or be actively supported if the corresponding AKS version has reached end of life. You can check the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](./supported-kubernetes-versions.md#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar) for information on AKS version support windows.

## Configure OSM CLI variables with an OSM_CONFIG file

Users can override the default OSM CLI configuration to enhance the add-on experience. This can be done by creating a config file, similar to `kubeconfig`. The config file can be either created at `$HOME/.osm/config.yaml`, or at a different path that is exported using the `OSM_CONFIG` environment variable.

The file must contain the following YAML formatted content:

```yaml
install:
  kind: managed
  distribution: AKS
  namespace: kube-system
```

If the file is not created at `$HOME/.osm/config.yaml`, remember to set the `OSM_CONFIG` environment variable to point to the path where the config file is created.

After setting OSM_CONFIG, the output of the `osm env` command should be the following:

```console
$ osm env
---
install:
  kind: managed
  distribution: AKS
  namespace: kube-system
```
