# Migrate from HTTP application routing to the application routing add-on

In this article, you learn how to migrate your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from HTTP application routing feature to the [application routing add-on](./app-routing.md). The HTTP application routing add-on has been retired and doesn't work on any cluster Kubernetes version currently in support. We recommend migrating as soon as possible to maintain a supported configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI version 2.54.0 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].
- `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension of version 0.5.171 or later installed

> [!NOTE]
> These steps detail migrating from an unsupported configuration. As such, AKS cannot offer support for issues that arise during the migration process.

## Update your cluster's add-ons, Ingresses, and IP usage

1. Enable the application routing add-on.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks approuting enable --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <ClusterName>
    ```

2. Update your Ingresses, setting `ingressClassName` to `webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com`. Remove the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation. You also need to update the host to one that you own, as the application routing add-on doesn't have a managed cluster DNS zone. If you don't have a DNS zone, follow instructions to [create][app-routing-dns-create] and [configure][app-routing-dns-configure] one.

    Initially, your ingress configuration will look something like this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: aks-helloworld
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: addon-http-application-routing  # Remove the ingress class annotation
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: aks-helloworld.<CLUSTER_SPECIFIC_DNS_ZONE>
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: aks-helloworld
                port:
                  number: 80
    ```

    After you've properly updated, the same configuration looks like the following:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: aks-helloworld
    spec:
      ingressClassName: webapprouting.kubernetes.azure.com # Set the ingress class property to refer to the application routing add-on ingress class
      rules:
      - http:
        host: aks-helloworld.<CLUSTER_SPECIFIC_DNS_ZONE> # Replace with your own hostname
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: aks-helloworld
                port:
                  number: 80
    ```

3. Update the Ingress controller's IP (such as in DNS records) with the new IP address. You can find the new IP by using `kubectl get`. For example:

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc nginx --namespace app-routing-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
    ```

4. Disable the HTTP application routing add-on.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks disable-addons --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <ClusterName> --addons http_application_routing
    ```

## Remove and delete all HTTP application routing resources

1. After the HTTP application routing add-on is disabled, some related Kubernetes resources might remain in your cluster. These resources include *configmaps* and *secrets* that are created in the *kube-system* namespace. To maintain a clean cluster, you can remove these resources. Look for *addon-http-application-routing* resources using the following [`kubectl get`][kubectl-get] commands:

    ```bash
    kubectl get deployments --namespace kube-system
    kubectl get services --namespace kube-system
    kubectl get configmaps --namespace kube-system
    kubectl get secrets --namespace kube-system
    ```

    The following example output shows *configmaps* that should be deleted:

    ```output
    NAMESPACE     NAME                                                       DATA   AGE
    kube-system   addon-http-application-routing-nginx-configuration         0      9m7s
    kube-system   addon-http-application-routing-tcp-services                0      9m7s
    kube-system   addon-http-application-routing-udp-services                0      9m7s
    ```

1. Delete remaining resources using the [`kubectl delete`][kubectl-delete] command. Make sure to specify the resource type, resource name, and namespace. The following example deletes one of the previous configmaps:

    ```bash
    kubectl delete configmaps addon-http-application-routing-nginx-configuration --namespace kube-system
    ```

1. Repeat the previous `kubectl delete` step for all *addon-http-application-routing* resources remaining in your cluster.

## Next steps
