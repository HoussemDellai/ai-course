# Manage local accounts with AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration

When you deploy an AKS cluster, local accounts are enabled by default. Even when you enable RBAC or Microsoft Entra integration, `--admin` access still exists as a non-auditable backdoor option. This article shows you how to disable local accounts on an existing cluster, create a new cluster with local accounts disabled, and re-enable local accounts on existing clusters.

## Before you begin

* See [AKS-managed Microsoft Entra integration](./managed-azure-ad.md) for an overview and setup instructions.

## Disable local accounts

You can disable local accounts using the parameter `disable-local-accounts`. The `properties.disableLocalAccounts` field has been added to the managed cluster API to indicate whether the feature is enabled or not on the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * On clusters with Microsoft Entra integration enabled, users assigned to a Microsoft Entra administrators group specified by `aad-admin-group-object-ids` can still gain access using non-administrator credentials. On clusters without Microsoft Entra integration enabled and `properties.disableLocalAccounts` set to `true`, any attempt to authenticate with user or admin credentials will fail.
>
> * After disabling local user accounts on an existing AKS cluster where users might have authenticated with local accounts, the administrator must [rotate the cluster certificates](certificate-rotation.md) to revoke certificates they might have had access to. If this is a new cluster, no action is required.

### Create a new cluster without local accounts

1. Create a new AKS cluster without any local accounts using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command with the `disable-local-accounts` flag.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create \
        --resource-group <resource-group> \
        --name <cluster-name> \
        --enable-aad \
        --aad-admin-group-object-ids <aad-group-id> \
        --disable-local-accounts \
        --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

2. In the output, confirm local accounts are disabled by checking that the field `properties.disableLocalAccounts` is set to `true`.

    ```output
    "properties": {
        ...
        "disableLocalAccounts": true,
        ...
    }
    ```

3. Run the [`az aks get-credentials`][az-aks-get-credentials] command to ensure the cluster is set to disable local accounts.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin
    ```

    Your output should show the following error message indicating the feature is preventing access:

    ```output
    Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'. Details: Getting static credential isn't allowed because this cluster is set to disable local accounts.
    ```

### Disable local accounts on an existing cluster

1. Disable local accounts on an existing Microsoft Entra integration enabled AKS cluster using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command with the `disable-local-accounts` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --disable-local-accounts
    ```

2. In the output, confirm local accounts are disabled by checking that the field `properties.disableLocalAccounts` is set to `true`.

    ```output
    "properties": {
        ...
        "disableLocalAccounts": true,
        ...
    }
    ```

3. Run the [`az aks get-credentials`][az-aks-get-credentials] command to ensure the cluster is set to disable local accounts.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin
    ```

    Your output should show the following error message indicating the feature is preventing access:

    ```output
    Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'. Details: Getting static credential isn't allowed because this cluster is set to disable local accounts.
    ```

### Re-enable local accounts on an existing cluster

1. Re-enable a disabled local account on an existing cluster using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command with the `enable-local-accounts` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --enable-local-accounts
    ```

2. In the output, confirm local accounts are re-enabled by checking that the field `properties.disableLocalAccounts` is set to `false`.

    ```output
    "properties": {
        ...
        "disableLocalAccounts": false,
        ...
    }
    ```

3. Run the [`az aks get-credentials`][az-aks-get-credentials] command to ensure the cluster is set to enable local accounts.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin
    ```

    Your output should show the following message indicating you have successfully enabled local accounts on the cluster:

    ```output
    Merged "<cluster-name>-admin" as current context in C:\Users\<username>\.kube\config
    ```
