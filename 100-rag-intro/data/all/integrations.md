# Add-ons, extensions, and other integrations with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides extra functionality for your clusters using add-ons and extensions. Open-source projects and third parties provide by more integrations that are commonly used with AKS. The [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy] doesn't support the open-source and third-party integrations.

## Add-ons

Add-ons are a fully supported way to provide extra capabilities for your AKS cluster. The installation, configuration, and lifecycle of add-ons are managed on AKS. You can use the [`az aks enable-addons`][az-aks-enable-addons] command to install an add-on or manage the add-ons for your cluster.

AKS uses the following rules for applying updates to installed add-ons:

- Only an add-on's patch version can be upgraded within a Kubernetes minor version. The add-on's major/minor version isn't upgraded within the same Kubernetes minor version.
- The major/minor version of the add-on is only upgraded when moving to a later Kubernetes minor version.
- Any breaking or behavior changes to the add-on are announced well before, usually 60 days, for a GA minor version of Kubernetes on AKS.
- You can patch add-ons weekly with every new release of AKS, which is announced in the release notes. You can control AKS releases using the [maintenance windows][maintenance-windows] and [release tracker][release-tracker].

### Exceptions

- Add-ons are upgraded to a new major/minor version (or breaking change) within a Kubernetes minor version if either the cluster's Kubernetes version or the add-on version are in preview.
- There can be unavoidable circumstances, such as CVE security patches or critical bug fixes, when you need to update an add-on within a GA minor version.

### Available add-ons

## Extensions

Cluster extensions build on top of certain Helm charts and provide an Azure Resource Manager-driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of different Azure capabilities on top of your Kubernetes cluster.

- For more information on the specific cluster extensions for AKS, see [Deploy and manage cluster extensions for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][cluster-extensions].
- For more information on available cluster extensions, see [Currently available extensions][cluster-extensions-current].

### Difference between extensions and add-ons

Extensions and add-ons are both supported ways to add functionality to your AKS cluster. When you install an add-on, the functionality is added as part of the AKS resource provider in the Azure API. When you install an extension, the functionality is added as part of a separate resource provider in the Azure API.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows from within GitHub.

- For more information on using GitHub Actions with Azure, see [GitHub Actions for Azure][github-actions].
- For an example of using GitHub Actions with an AKS cluster, see [Build, test, and deploy containers to Azure Kubernetes Service using GitHub Actions][github-actions-aks].

## Open-source and third-party integrations

There are many open-source and third-party integrations you can install on your AKS cluster. The [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy] doesn't support the following open-source and third-party integrations.

| Name | Description | More details |
|---|---|---|
| [Helm][helm] | An open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. | [Quickstart: Develop on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Helm][helm-qs] |
| [Prometheus][prometheus] | An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. | [Container insights with metrics in Prometheus format][prometheus-az-monitor], [Prometheus Helm chart][prometheus-helm-chart] |

### Third-party integrations for Windows containers

Microsoft collaborates with partners to ensure the build, test, deployment, configuration, and monitoring of your applications perform optimally with Windows containers on AKS.
