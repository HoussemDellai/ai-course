# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Terraform

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this quickstart, you:

* Deploy an AKS cluster using Terraform.
* Run a sample multi-container application with a group of microservices and web front ends simulating a retail scenario.

> [!NOTE]
> To get started with quickly provisioning an AKS cluster, this article includes steps to deploy a cluster with default settings for evaluation purposes only. Before deploying a production-ready cluster, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with our [baseline reference architecture][baseline-reference-architecture] to consider how it aligns with your business requirements.

## Before you begin

* This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].
* You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* Follow the instructions based on your command line interface.

:::zone pivot="development-environment-azure-cli"

* To learn more about creating a Windows Server node pool, see [Create an AKS cluster that supports Windows Server containers](quick-windows-container-deploy-cli.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Linux node pool is now in general availablility (GA). To learn about the benefits and deployment steps, see the [Introduction to the Azure Linux Container Host for AKS][intro-azure-linux].

* [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).
* [Download kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/).
* Create a random value for the Azure resource group name using [random_pet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/pet).
* Create an Azure resource group using [azurerm_resource_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group).
* Access the configuration of the AzureRM provider to get the Azure Object ID using [azurerm_client_config](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/client_config).
* Create a Kubernetes cluster using [azurerm_kubernetes_cluster](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kubernetes_cluster).
* Create an AzAPI resource [azapi_resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Azure/azapi/latest/docs/resources/azapi_resource).
* Create an AzAPI resource to generate an SSH key pair using [azapi_resource_action](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Azure/azapi/latest/docs/resources/azapi_resource_action).

## Login to your Azure account

First, log into your Azure account and authenticate using one of the methods described in the following section.

[!INCLUDE [authenticate-to-azure.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/authenticate-to-azure.md)]

## Implement the Terraform code

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code for this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks). You can view the log file containing the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks/TestRecord.md).
>
> See more [articles and sample code showing how to use Terraform to manage Azure resources](/azure/terraform)

1. Create a directory you can use to test the sample Terraform code and make it your current directory.

1. Create a file named `providers.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](~/terraform_samples/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks/providers.tf)]

1. Create a file named `ssh.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](~/terraform_samples/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks/ssh.tf)]

1. Create a file named `main.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](~/terraform_samples/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks/main.tf)]

1. Create a file named `variables.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](~/terraform_samples/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks/variables.tf)]

1. Create a file named `outputs.tf` and insert the following code:

    [!code-terraform[master](~/terraform_samples/quickstart/201-k8s-cluster-with-tf-and-aks/outputs.tf)]

## Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-init.md)]

## Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## Verify the results

1. Get the Azure resource group name using the following command.

    ```console
    resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)
    ```

2. Display the name of your new Kubernetes cluster using the [az aks list](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-list) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks list \
      --resource-group $resource_group_name \
      --query "[].{\"K8s cluster name\":name}" \
      --output table
    ```

3. Get the Kubernetes configuration from the Terraform state and store it in a file that `kubectl` can read using the following command.

    ```console
    echo "$(terraform output kube_config)" > ./azurek8s
    ```

4. Verify the previous command didn't add an ASCII EOT character using the following command.

    ```console
    cat ./azurek8s
    ```

   **Key points:**

    * If you see `<< EOT` at the beginning and `EOT` at the end, remove these characters from the file. Otherwise, you may receive the following error message: `error: error loading config file "./azurek8s": yaml: line 2: mapping values are not allowed in this context`

5. Set an environment variable so `kubectl` can pick up the correct config using the following command.

    ```console
    export KUBECONFIG=./azurek8s
    ```

6. Verify the health of the cluster using the `kubectl get nodes` command.

    ```console
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

**Key points:**

* When you created the AKS cluster, monitoring was enabled to capture health metrics for both the cluster nodes and pods. These health metrics are available in the Azure portal. For more information on container health monitoring, see [Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service health](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-overview).
* Several key values classified as output when you applied the Terraform execution plan. For example, the host address, AKS cluster user name, and AKS cluster password are output.

## Deploy the application

To deploy the application, you use a manifest file to create all the objects required to run the [AKS Store application][aks-store-demo]. A [Kubernetes manifest file][kubernetes-deployment] defines a cluster's desired state, such as which container images to run. The manifest includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

:::image type="content" source="media/quick-kubernetes-deploy-terraform/aks-store-architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Store sample architecture." lightbox="media/quick-kubernetes-deploy-terraform/aks-store-architecture.png":::

* **Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.
* **Product service**: Shows product information.
* **Order service**: Places orders.
* **Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. These are used here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure CosmosDB or Azure Service Bus.

1. Create a file named `aks-store-quickstart.yaml` and copy in the following manifest:

    ```yaml

    ```

    For a breakdown of YAML manifest files, see [Deployments and YAML manifests](../concepts-clusters-workloads.md#deployments-and-yaml-manifests).

    If you create and save the YAML file locally, then you can upload the manifest file to your default directory in CloudShell by selecting the **Upload/Download files** button and selecting the file from your local file system.

2. Deploy the application using the `kubectl apply` command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f aks-store-quickstart.yaml
    ```

    The following example output shows the deployments and services:

    ```output
    deployment.apps/rabbitmq created
    service/rabbitmq created
    deployment.apps/order-service created
    service/order-service created
    deployment.apps/product-service created
    service/product-service created
    deployment.apps/store-front created
    service/store-front created
    ```

### Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

1. Check the status of the deployed pods using the `kubectl get pods` command. Make all pods are `Running` before proceeding.

    ```console
    kubectl get pods
    ```

2. Check for a public IP address for the store-front application. Monitor progress using the `kubectl get service` command with the `--watch` argument.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl get service store-front --watch
    ```

    The **EXTERNAL-IP** output for the `store-front` service initially shows as *pending*:

    ```output
    NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.100.10   <pending>     80:30025/TCP   4h4m
    ```

3. Once the **EXTERNAL-IP** address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

    The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

    ```output
    NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
    store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.100.10   20.62.159.19   80:30025/TCP   4h5m
    ```

4. Open a web browser to the external IP address of your service to see the Azure Store app in action.

## Clean up resources

### Delete AKS resources

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan-destroy.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan-destroy.md)]

### Delete service principal

1. Get the service principal ID using the following command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    sp=$(terraform output -raw sp)
    ```

1. Delete the service principal using the [az ad sp delete](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-delete) command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ad sp delete --id $sp
    ```

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="development-environment-azure-developer"

* [Install the Azure Developer CLI (AZD)][azd-install]
* [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).
* You can review the application code used in the Azure-Samples/[aks-store-demo repo][aks-store-demo].

## Clone the Azure Developer CLI template

The Azure Developer CLI allows you to quickly download samples from the **Azure-Samples** repository. In our quickstart, you download the `aks-store-demo` application. For more information on the general uses cases, see the [`azd` overview][azd-overview].

1. Clone the AKS store demo template from the **Azure-Samples** repository using the [`azd init`][azd-init] command with the `--template` parameter.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd init --template Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo
    ```

2. Enter an environment name for your project that uses only alphanumeric characters and hyphens, such as *aks-terraform-1*.

    ```output
    Enter a new environment name: aks-terraform-1
    ```

## Sign in to your Azure Cloud account

The `azd` template contains all the code needed to create the services, but you need to sign in to your Azure account in order to host the application on AKS.

1. Sign in to your account using the [`azd auth login`][az-auth-login] command.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd auth login
    ```

2. Copy the device code that appears in the output and press enter to sign in.

    ```output
    Start by copying the next code: XXXXXXXXX
    Then press enter and continue to log in from your browser...
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you're using an out-of-network virtual machine or GitHub Codespace, certain Azure security policies cause conflicts when used to sign in with `azd auth login`. If you run into an issue here, you can follow the azd auth workaround provided, which involves using a `curl` request to the localhost URL you were redirected to after running [`azd auth login`][az-auth-login].

3. Authenticate with your credentials on your organization's sign in page.
4. Confirm that it's you trying to connect from the Azure CLI.
5. Verify the message "Device code authentication completed. Logged in to Azure." appears in your original terminal.

    ```output
    Waiting for you to complete authentication in the browser...
    Device code authentication completed.
    Logged in to Azure.
    ```
[!INCLUDE [azd-login-ts](../includes/azd/azd-login-ts.md)]

## Create and deploy resources for your cluster

To deploy the application, you use the `azd up` command to create all the objects required to run the [AKS Store application][aks-store-demo]. 

* An `azure.yaml` file defines a cluster's desired state, such as which container images to fetch and includes the following Kubernetes deployments and services:

:::image type="content" source="media/quick-kubernetes-deploy-terraform/aks-store-architecture.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the Azure Store sample architecture." lightbox="media/quick-kubernetes-deploy-terraform/aks-store-architecture.png":::

* **Store front**: Web application for customers to view products and place orders.
* **Product service**: Shows product information.
* **Order service**: Places orders.
* **Rabbit MQ**: Message queue for an order queue.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend running stateful containers, such as Rabbit MQ, without persistent storage for production. These are used here for simplicity, but we recommend using managed services, such as Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Service Bus.

### Deploy application resources

The `azd` template for this quickstart creates a new resource group with an AKS cluster and an Azure Key Vault. The key vault stores client secrets and runs the services in the `pets` namespace.

1. Create all the application resources using the [`azd up`][azd-up] command.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd up
    ```

    `azd up` runs all the hooks inside of the [`azd-hooks` folder](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo/tree/main/azd-hooks) to preregister, provision, and deploy the application services.

    Customize hooks to add custom code into the `azd` workflow stages. For more information, see the [`azd` hooks][azd-hooks] reference.    

2. Select an Azure subscription for your billing usage.

    ```output
    ? Select an Azure Subscription to use:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
    > 1. My Azure Subscription (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
    ```

3. Select a region to deploy your application to.

    ```output
    Select an Azure location to use:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
      1.  (South America) Brazil Southeast (brazilsoutheast)
      2.  (US) Central US (centralus)
      3.  (US) East US (eastus)
    > 43. (US) East US 2 (eastus2)
      4.  (US) East US STG (eastusstg)
      5.  (US) North Central US (northcentralus)
      6.  (US) South Central US (southcentralus)
    ```

    `azd` automatically runs the preprovision and postprovision hooks to create the resources for your application. This process can take a few minutes to complete. Once complete, you should see an output similar to the following example:

    ```output
    SUCCESS: Your workflow to provision and deploy to Azure completed in 9 minutes 40 seconds.
    ```

### Generate Terraform plans

Within your Azure Developer template, the `/infra/terraform` folder contains all the code used to generate the Terraform plan.

Terraform deploys and runs commands using `terraform apply` as part of `azd`'s provisioning step. Once complete, you should see an output similar to the following example:

```output
Plan: 5 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
...
Saved the plan to: /workspaces/aks-store-demo/.azure/aks-terraform-azd/infra/terraform/main.tfplan
```

## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

1. Set your namespace as the demo namespace `pets` using the [`kubectl set-context`][kubectl-set-context] command.

    ```console
    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=pets
    ```

2. Check the status of the deployed pods using the [`kubectl get pods`][kubectl-get-pods] command. Make sure all pods are `Running` before proceeding.

    ```console
    kubectl get pods
    ```

3. Check for a public IP address for the store-front application and monitor progress using the [`kubectl get service`][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

    ```console
    kubectl get service store-front --watch
    ```

    The **EXTERNAL-IP** output for the `store-front` service initially shows as *pending*:

    ```output
    NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.100.10   <pending>     80:30025/TCP   4h4m
    ```

4. Once the **EXTERNAL-IP** address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

    The following sample output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

    ```output
    NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
    store-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.100.10   20.62.159.19   80:30025/TCP   4h5m
    ```

5. Open a web browser to the external IP address of your service to see the Azure Store app in action.

## Delete the cluster

Once you're finished with the quickstart, clean up unnecessary resources to avoid Azure charges.

1. Delete all the resources created in the quickstart using the [`azd down`][azd-down] command.

    ```azdeveloper
    azd down
    ```

2. Confirm your decision to remove all used resources from your subscription by typing `y` and pressing `Enter`.

    ```output
    ? Total resources to delete: 14, are you sure you want to continue? (y/N)
    ```

3. Allow purge to reuse the quickstart variables if applicable by typing `y` and pressing `Enter`.

    ```output
    [Warning]: These resources have soft delete enabled allowing them to be recovered for a period or time after deletion. During this period, their names can't be reused. In the future, you can use the argument --purge to skip this confirmation.
    ```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and then deployed a simple multi-container application to it. This sample application is for demo purposes only and doesn't represent all the best practices for Kubernetes applications. For guidance on creating full solutions with AKS for production, see [AKS solution guidance][aks-solution-guidance].

To learn more about AKS and walk through a complete code-to-deployment example, continue to the Kubernetes cluster tutorial.
