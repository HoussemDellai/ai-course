# Outbound network and FQDN rules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters

This article provides the necessary details that allow you to secure outbound traffic from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It contains the cluster requirements for a base AKS deployment and additional requirements for optional addons and features. You can apply this information to any outbound restriction method or appliance.

To see an example configuration using Azure Firewall, visit [Control egress traffic using Azure Firewall in AKS](limit-egress-traffic.md).

## Background

AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network. This network can either be customized and pre-configured by you or it can be created and managed by AKS. In either case, the cluster has **outbound**, or egress, dependencies on services outside of the virtual network.

For management and operational purposes, nodes in an AKS cluster need to access certain ports and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). These endpoints are required for the nodes to communicate with the API server or to download and install core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates. For example, the cluster needs to pull base system container images from Microsoft Container Registry (MCR).

The AKS outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which don't have static addresses behind them. The lack of static addresses means you can't use network security groups (NSGs) to lock down the outbound traffic from an AKS cluster.

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound internet access. This level of network access allows nodes and services you run to access external resources as needed. If you wish to restrict egress traffic, a limited number of ports and addresses must be accessible to maintain healthy cluster maintenance tasks. The simplest solution to securing outbound addresses is using a firewall device that can control outbound traffic based on domain names. Azure Firewall can restrict outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on the FQDN of the destination. You can also configure your preferred firewall and security rules to allow these required ports and addresses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This document covers only how to lock down the traffic leaving the AKS subnet. AKS has no ingress requirements by default. Blocking **internal subnet traffic** using network security groups (NSGs) and firewalls isn't supported. To control and block the traffic within the cluster, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS][use-network-policies].

## Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters

The following network and FQDN/application rules are required for an AKS cluster. You can use them if you wish to configure a solution other than Azure Firewall.

* IP address dependencies are for non-HTTP/S traffic (both TCP and UDP traffic).
* FQDN HTTP/HTTPS endpoints can be placed in your firewall device.
* Wildcard HTTP/HTTPS endpoints are dependencies that can vary with your AKS cluster based on a number of qualifiers.
* AKS uses an admission controller to inject the FQDN as an environment variable to all deployments under kube-system and gatekeeper-system. This ensures all system communication between nodes and API server uses the API server FQDN and not the API server IP.  You can get the same behavior on your own pods, in any namespace, by annotating the pod spec with an annotation named `kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn`. If that annotation is present, AKS will set the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST variable to the domain name of the API server instead of the in-cluster service IP. This is useful in cases where the cluster egress is via a layer 7 firewall.
* If you have an app or solution that needs to talk to the API server, you must either add an **additional** network rule to allow **TCP communication to port 443 of your API server's IP** **OR** , if you have a layer 7 firewall configured to allow traffic to the API Server's domain name, set `kubernetes.azure.com/set-kube-service-host-fqdn` in your pod specs.
* On rare occasions, if there's a maintenance operation, your API server IP might change. Planned maintenance operations that can change the API server IP are always communicated in advance.
* Under certain circumstances, it might happen that traffic towards "md-*.blob.storage.azure.net" is required. This dependency is due to some internal mechanisms of Azure Managed Disks. You might also want to use the Storage [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md).

## Optional recommended FQDN / application rules for AKS clusters

The following FQDN / application rules aren't required, but are recommended for AKS clusters:

| Destination FQDN                                                               | Port          | Use      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| **`security.ubuntu.com`, `azure.archive.ubuntu.com`, `changelogs.ubuntu.com`** | **`HTTP:80`** | This address lets the Linux cluster nodes download the required security patches and updates. |

If you choose to block/not allow these FQDNs, the nodes will only receive OS updates when you do a [node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade.md) or [cluster upgrade](upgrade-cluster.md). Keep in mind that node image upgrades also come with updated packages including security fixes.

## GPU enabled AKS clusters required FQDN / application rules

| Destination FQDN                        | Port      | Use      |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|----------|

| **`us.download.nvidia.com`**            | **`HTTPS:443`** | This address is used for correct driver installation and operation on GPU-based nodes. |
| **`download.docker.com`**             | **`HTTPS:443`** | This address is used for correct driver installation and operation on GPU-based nodes. |

## Windows Server based node pools required FQDN / application rules

| Destination FQDN                                                           | Port      | Use      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|

| **`*.mp.microsoft.com, www.msftconnecttest.com, ctldl.windowsupdate.com`** | **`HTTP:80`**   | To install windows-related binaries |

If you choose to block/not allow these FQDNs, the nodes will only receive OS updates when you do a [node image upgrade](node-image-upgrade.md) or [cluster upgrade](upgrade-cluster.md). Keep in mind that Node Image Upgrades also come with updated packages including security fixes.

## Next steps

In this article, you learned what ports and addresses to allow if you want to restrict egress traffic for the cluster.

If you want to restrict how pods communicate between themselves and East-West traffic restrictions within cluster see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in AKS][use-network-policies].
