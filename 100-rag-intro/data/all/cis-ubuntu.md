# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Ubuntu image alignment with Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark

As a secure service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) complies with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards. This article covers the security OS configuration applied to Ubuntu image used by AKS. This security configuration is based on the Azure Linux security baseline, which aligns with CIS benchmark. For more information about AKS security, see Security concepts for applications and clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). For more information about AKS security, see [Security concepts for applications and clusters in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][security-concepts-aks-apps-clusters]. For more information on the CIS benchmark, see [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks][cis-benchmarks]. For more information on the Azure security baselines for Linux, see [Linux security baseline][linux-security-baseline].

## Ubuntu LTS 18.04

AKS clusters are deployed on host virtual machines, which run an operating system with built-in secure configurations. This operating system is used for containers running on AKS. This host operating system is based on an **Ubuntu 18.04.LTS** image with security configurations applied. 

As a part of the security-optimized operating system:

* AKS provides a security-optimized host OS by default, but no option to select an alternate operating system.
* The security-optimized host OS is built and maintained specifically for AKS and is **not** supported outside of the AKS platform.
* Some unnecessary kernel module drivers have been disabled in the OS to reduce the attack surface area.

> [!NOTE]
> Unrelated to the CIS benchmarks, Azure applies daily patches, including security patches, to AKS virtual machine hosts.

The goal of the secure configuration built into the host OS is to reduce the surface area of attack and optimize for the deployment of containers in a secure manner.

The following are the results from the [CIS Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Benchmark v2.1.0][cis-benchmark-ubuntu] recommendations.

Recommendations can have one of the following reasons:

* *Potential Operation Impact* - Recommendation wasn't applied because it would have a negative effect on the service.
* *Covered Elsewhere* - Recommendation is covered by another control in Azure cloud compute.
